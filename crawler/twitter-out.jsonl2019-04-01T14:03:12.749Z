You must be logged in to use this feature.","Michele Romanow, who is a Canadian technology entrepreneur, television personality and venture capitalist, poses for a photo at her Toronto home on Sept. 26, 2016.","Michelle Siu/The Globe and Mail","Dragons’ Den star Michele Romanow’s online financing company, Clearbanc, was born out of the frustrations she faced when launching her previous company, Buytopia.ca. At the time, she didn’t want to get financing from the banks because they all wanted personal guarantees against her assets. Getting venture capital wasn’t ideal either, as she didn’t want to give up equity in the company. “It meant we had to run everything on a shoestring budget instead of getting to grow faster,” Ms. Romanow says.","Her experiences fuelled her to launch Clearbanc, which caters to e-commerce companies that want money for marketing. The financing company promises you can apply online “in minutes” and says money can arrive in entrepreneurs’ bank accounts in as little as 24 hours.","There’s no set repayment date, so if business is slow, entrepreneurs can take more time to pay. Ms. Romanow says applying has no impact on the owner’s or the business’s credit scores, and Clearbanc has no claim to the entrepreneurs’ personal assets. “This is the product I wished I had during the early days of my business,” she says.","Story continues below advertisement","Another selling point is the simple structure. “We make it really clear what your cost of capital is,” Ms. Romanow says. “We charge 6 per cent for our capital. If we give you $100,000, you owe us $106,000 at the end of that.” She says the fee is always 6 per cent and there are no extra fees charged on top.","There’s been a lot of excitement about the four-year-old company, and it raised US$120-million in venture capital to fund its growth last year. It all sounds great, but does Clearbanc live up to its lofty claims? We talked to Clearbanc customers and financing expert Andrew Zakharia to find out.","Getting set up","Applicants give Clearbanc read-only digital access to their business bank account and payment-processing accounts (for example Stripe, Square, Shopify or Paypal). They also need to give access to their online ad spending accounts, typically Google Ads or Facebook.","“We are looking for positive unit economics,” Ms. Romanow says. “If you are making really cool wooden iPhone cases, we’re just verifying you’re making those cases for $10, selling for $50 and it’s costing $10 in Facebook ads to sell a case.”","Ms. Romanow says that while you can get funded in as little as 24 hours, often business owners don’t remember the passwords to all their accounts and phone with a few questions, so it typically takes around a week to get set up.","Businesses need to have an average monthly revenue of at least $10,000 for the past six months, and must share their articles of incorporation. Ms. Romanow won’t reveal Clearbanc’s approval rate, but says “it’s pretty high.”","Mr. Zakharia, an accountant and founder of AZ Accounting Firm in Toronto, recently got a Clearbanc advance on behalf of one of his e-commerce clients.","Story continues below advertisement","“The whole process of connecting was very simple. It took 20 to 30 minutes to apply and I called to ask one question. It took three days to get approved and the money arrived five days after that.”","Michael McNaught, founder of RV rental marketplace RVezy, got an advance from Clearbanc last fall. “It was a very smooth, transparent and simple process to follow,” he says. “We got access to the funding within days of the application.”","Mr. McNaught says Clearbanc is a welcome alternative to banks, which are reluctant to lend to digital companies without physical assets. “We are then able to deploy those funds to directly fuel our growth without giving up any equity in the company.”","Clearbanc advances start at $10,000 and the largest one it has done was for $10-million, for a company that used it as an alternative to raising a Series B venture round. The money advanced is supposed to be put toward marketing, which includes buying online ads and hiring a marketing agency. The funds are deposited in the company’s bank account or added to a “Clearbanc debit card,” which can be used anywhere that accepts Visa or Mastercard.","While the product is currently available for e-commerce companies only, Ms. Romanow has plans for expansion. She says in addition to expanding internationally, Clearbanc is testing models to allow software-as-a-service companies to use the platform.","Payback time","The money Clearbanc gives out is considered a cash advance on future sales, not a loan. The funds are repaid by having the business’s payment processor route an agreed upon percentage of future revenues to Clearbanc until the advance and the fee are repaid. The payback rate ranges from 1 per cent to 20 per cent of sales.","Story continues below advertisement","Ms. Romanow told The Globe and Mail and other media outlets that the only cost is a flat fee of 6 per cent on the amount advanced, but it turns out that’s not always the case. While the majority of the businesses we spoke with paid a 6 per cent fee, one paid 8 per cent.","When asked for clarification, Ms. Romanow says: “Depending on how you use our capital, it’s 6 per cent to 12 per cent. It’s cheaper – 6 per cent – if you use our capital on digital ads like Facebook and Google because we have deep data science and understand the paybacks so we can offer lower fees. The vast majority of our fees are at the lower range.” The Clearbanc website doesn’t list the cost of an advance, but says the fee is “determined based on your business data.”","It’s important to understand that the 6-per-cent to 12-per-cent advance fee isn’t the same as the APR, or annual percentage rate you’d see on a traditional loan. That’s because the amount of time it takes to repay the Clearbanc advance could vary. Ms. Romanow says the businesses typically repay the advances in six to 12 months.","Things to watch out for","The e-commerce companies we spoke with that used Clearbanc were very enthusiastic about the service. Jesse Burnett, co-founder of Toronto footwear company TKEES, says he wouldn’t hesitate to get another advance from the company.","“Our ability to grow has been capped by our access to capital. So any time we have access to capital, I can free up capital for other places in the business,” he said. \"2018 was a solid growth year for us and we’re looking to Clearbanc to accelerate that this year.”","Mr. Zakharia agrees that Clearbanc is a good option because it’s quick, there’s no personal credit check and the entrepreneur doesn’t need to put personal assets on the line. In terms of the cost, he says Clearbanc is reasonable when compared with other online lenders.","Story continues below advertisement","An 8-per-cent advance fee works out to the equivalent of a 27-per-cent APR if it’s paid back in six months with relatively consistent payments, Mr. Zakharia calculates. If paid back over one year, the APR would be approximately 14.5 per cent. This compares with the 20 per cent to 30 per cent or more that other online lenders typically charge, he says.","However, business owners should be aware there could be lower cost options. “I’d go first to a traditional bank followed by the BDC [Business Development Bank of Canada] if you want the lowest interest rate,” Mr. Zakharia says. “But if someone doesn’t want to involve their personal credit, then Clearbanc would be the best.”","Mr. Zakharia warns that businesses should only use a product like this that cuts into future revenues if the money is going to bring in additional sales. Using funds such as this to cover fixed costs could set a business up for cash-flow problems. “If you’re relying on this money to fund your operations, this could get you in trouble because you will have less cash available until this loan is paid off.”","The Globe and Mail Small Business Summit will give you practical ideas to grow your business. This year’s speakers include former Dragon’s Den star David Chilton, Kate Ross Leblanc from Saje Natural Wellness and celebrity chef Mark McEwan.","Related","Welcome to The Globe and Mail’s comment community.

In this post, Andy Tattersall draws on best practice from the sphere of viral marketing to develop the concept of ‘Scholarly Enticement’. He then presents a toolbox of simple techniques that can be applied by anyone across any discipline, to enhance the Scholarly Enticement of research.","Academia has a lot to learn from the outside world, especially the Web. The pressure on researchers to generate impact and attention have meant academics have tried to explore new and inventive ways of communicating their research. Many research papers fail to receive any attention at all and there may be a way to help them reach wider audiences outside of the academic domain. Given the success of email phishing and more recently clickbait websites, there may be some value in employing the former to disseminate outputs. Clickbait is a very negative term and has received a lot of bad publicity in recent years. My proposal is for the term ‘scholarly enticement’ to be used as a way to lure curious readers to explore your latest research. The principles of clickbait can be applied to ensure research using this method has:","The research itself will remain untouched and not follow the principles of churnalism or yellow journalism. The aim of scholarly enticement is to get the reader to visit your works although there is no evidence they will stay there.","Social analytics company BuzzSumo analysed 100 million headlines to find out what the top headline phrases were. They produced a list of three word phrases or trigrams that gained the most Facebook likes, shares and comments. To help academics align their research with the principles of scholarly enticement, I have created a template of common clickbait trigrams from top headline phrases and applied them to generic research titles. You can mix and match your clickbait phrase with your own research.","The mix and match list approach","In addition to some of the suggestions above, you can employ the list method. This is especially useful for quantitative research and is ideal for creating scholarly enticement across multiple pages. You can use a mixture of trigrams from the list above and create a research paper that has a title like this:","‘Interdisciplinary case study: 23 reasons why the planet is getting hotter and you won’t believe number 15.’","If your intelligence and analytical gathering for impact includes metrics such as page hits consider breaking your research up across 20 separate web pages. Each page should have enough scholarly enticement to ensure the reader proceeds on to the next web page in the sequence. It is important that you leave your most important findings till the very last page, that way you maximise the number of clicks on your website. In some cases it is legitimate to leave out your conclusions, results and in extreme cases all text and just use images.","Images are instrumental as part of the scholarly enticement process so it is important you apply the right images to accompany your research. For anyone seeking inspiration for their research I suggest you use these suggestions for images in the corresponding research.","Research and clickbait have surprising similarities (see my list of 25 similarities and you won’t believe number 18) which can help improve scholarly enticement. Research comes from curiosity to solve problems, that curiosity can be employed to draw attention from the outside. Research often explores human and emotional issues and clickbait titles are designed to play on our frailties, which in turn could gain you some valuable research impact. The truth is that for many of us we can’t resist clicking on the link, knowing full well it is clickbait. If academics can harness the skills of scholarly enticement they will see greater engagement with their research, just make sure you don’t link to the paywalled version of your work.","Note: This article is purely satire and clickbait should be treated with caution, furthermore the article gives the views of the author, and not the position of the LSE Impact Blog, nor of the London School of Economics.

With the star power of Sandra Bullock behind it, it even scored an Academy Award nomination for Best Film. Behind the scenes, however, drama had been brewing all along. For Michael Oher, the true story of his life was much different than what the movie portrayed and he was definitely taken aback by it all. Add in the elevated tensions that come with making a major motion picture, and it was the perfect recipe for drama on the set. Now, it’s time to find out what really happened.","1. Less Than Pleased","The Blind Side ended up being a huge success. Audiences loved it. Critics were generally pleased. The film even garnered plenty of awards and award nominations. Unfortunately, it did not quite satisfy one important person: the man on whom the film was based.","journalnow.com","Unfortunately, Michael Oher himself couldn’t stand the film. Even though actor Quinton Aaron played him well and as great as a guardian as actress Sandra Bullock might have seemed onscreen–Oher felt it was a poor representation of his life and went as far to say that the film did more damage than anything else.","2. A Different Personality","If you spent time with the real Michael Oher, you might quickly begin to understand why he was less than enthused with how Quinton Aaron portrayed him on the field. Not that Aaron’s performance was bad, of course; it just was not the real Big Mike.","Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images","For instance, the film portrays Michael Oher as being much more reserved, bordering on being a loner. He seems aloof, overly serious, even uptight. But Michael Oher is, in fact, quite the opposite. While he does what he needs to do to excel at his sport, he does it with a smile and a roar of a laugh. In other words, he never takes himself too seriously.","3. Oher’s Life Before the Tuohy Family","The film does not hide that Michael Oher endured a rocky past. It even states outright that he had been homeless and lacked any real family. This, of course, is just the simplified version cut neatly into digestible chunks for a movie that has a lot to cover in a short amount of time.","PopLyft","Oher indeed did have a tough life. His mother neglected him in favor of alcohol and drugs. Meanwhile, his father sat in prison, where he eventually was murdered. What’s more, Oher comes from a pretty large family. He is just one of 12 children, none of whom received the support they needed growing up.","4. When Michael Oher Met the Tuohy Family","In the film, the Tuohy family first encounters Michael Oher as a storm-battered boy left out in the rain, his clothes drenched and his body cold. The film would have most believe that that’s how their relationship began, with Oher moving in with them and then life starting fresh and anew. However, it was not quite like that.","Heavy.com","While the family did spot Michael Oher at the side of the road, they did not instantly pick him up at that moment. Some time passed, and the next day Leigh Anne Tuohy paid Michael a visit at his new school. After that, the two went shopping for new clothes. In short, the transition was a little more gradual and did not quite happen at the Hollywood pace.","5. Leigh Anne’s Day Job","In real life, Leigh Anne Tuohy worked as an interior designer. If you are particularly observant, you might have noticed that Leigh Anne mentioned Patrick Ramsey in the film. How are these two pieces of information related, you may be wondering?","Ole Hotty Toddy","Interestingly, Leigh Anne Tuohy worked for the Washington Redskins quarterback. Sure, the fact is not mentioned outright in the film, but the reference was not totally pointless. It was just a well-hidden Easter egg intended for only the most devout of football fans to uncover–and by devout, we mean those who are up to date on players’ home improvement strategies.","6. Racial Tension","In the film, race is mentioned a couple times: once by Sean Tuohy when he admits to his disbelief at having a black son, and again when a fellow player mentions it jeeringly to Oher during a game. Overall, though, the whole matter receives only cursory attention.","Pinterest.es","In real life, there was a lot more at stake for Michael Oher and the Tuohy family. Although the family enjoyed Oher’s presence and found it a pleasure to provide him with a home, Leigh Anne knew that her family might not be so pleased, as they tended to be racist at times. Still, Oher managed to fit in with his adoptive family fairly well, despite their difference.","7. Not All Home Sweet Home","Again, Hollywood embellishment rears its glittering head. In the film, Michael Oher appears to take to the Tuohy family immediately. The Tuohys see him as the perfect son and sibling, and Oher accepts them as the nurturing parents he never had. Sadly, things were not as sunny as the film might have you believe.","90skidsonly.com","Both parties had their doubts. Tension existed between them and likely never broke. Even so, things were far from terrible either. Oher still thinks fondly of his adoptive family. He ended up bonding pretty well with both S.J. and Collins Tuohy. However, it all took time and did not quite happen overnight. Again, that Hollywood illusion of instant perfection can be alluring but deceiving.","8. The True Story Behind His Mentor","In the film, Sandra Bullock plays a nurturing Leigh Ann Tuohy who ultimately instills in Michael an instant love for football. While Tuohy did play a major role in shaping the young football star, he did not gain all his training and all he needed to learn about the game from her.","Vulture","Michael Oher felt that in an attempt to milk out a touching mentor-and-mentee story, the director left out a lot of background information that would have shed some light on what it really took Oher to achieve what he did. As far as he is concerned, the film glossed over the hard work he himself put into reaching his goals.","9. Sandra Bullock Almost Was Not Leigh Anne Tuohy","One of the best things about The Blind Side is Sandra Bullock’s performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy. After all, she even won an Oscar and Golden Globe for her performance. But even she had her doubts about the part.","Pinterest","Sandra Bullock was offered the part several times but declined because the thought of portraying a pious Christian made her nervous. Bullock thought her mind was made up until she met the real Leigh Anne Tuohy. After that, she finally took the role. But she wasn’t the only choice for the part.","10. Julia Roberts Says No","So, who else exactly was a possible contender for the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy? Julia Roberts was offered the part, which of course would have been a sweet deal, given the film’s eventual success.","Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images","However, Julia Roberts turned the part down, feeling it was not right for her. Sandra Bullock took her place in the end, giving an exemplary performance that would reshape her career for the better–as will be even more evident further along in this list.","11. Just Years Apart","Most people who fell in love with the film and who were reasonably-devout football fans can see how Quinton Aaron might pass as as the football legend Michael Oher. They have the same build, after all, and stand pretty close in height. However, there is a small thing that separates the two.","Amirite","Quinton Aaron is actually slightly older than Michael Oher. His birth year is 1984, whereas Michael Oher was born in 1986. Still, the ages match up close enough for the difference to matter very little, right? Quinton Aaron still makes one fine Michael Oher!","12. Famous Friends","Although Michael Oher was not a fan of the film overall, he appears to harbor no ill feelings toward the actors and actresses who helped bring his story to life. In fact, one actress still plays quite the role in the football star’s life: none other than Sandra Bullock herself.","thecatholiccatalogue.com","She not only checks in on Oher from time to time, but also the entire Tuohy family. She also is incredibly enthusiastic about Michael Oher’s progress as an athlete and cheers him on whenever she has the opportunity. In fact, she can be found at many Super Bowl games sitting in the bleachers alongside his family, hoping to see him triumph.","13. From Security Guard to Hollywood Actor","You would be hard pressed to find a fan of the film who was not moved by Quinton Aaron’s stunning performance as Michael Oher himself. Believe or not, this was his first lead role and he had only dabbled in acting with small parts before The Blind Side.","ABC News – Go.com","Aaron was actually working as a security guard at the time he was cast, which is not hard to believe given his strength and stature. He did not expect to land the role when he auditioned and on his way out, gave his business card to director John Lee Hancock, offering to provide security services on the set during filming. Little did he know he would enjoy the spotlight after all.","14. More Concerns from Oher Himself","To this day, Michael Oher is not a huge fan of the film. It is not just because of how the film ended up portraying him as a person and as a football player. It is also because of how people perceive him today.","USA TODAY Sports","Oher laments that few people see him as he wants to be seen: a serious athlete who came a long way to achieve what he once thought was an unreachable dream. To his dismay, he feels that too many view him as that player who had a movie made about him.","15. Michael’s Time at Briarcrest Christian School","If you thought Michael Oher’s transition to Briarcrest Christian School was a bit too Hollywood-perfect, you were right. Like other parts of the film, actual events were embellished to evoke a greater emotional response from the audience.","ThingLink","In the film, the reluctant teachers instantly change their mind about allowing Oher in when they witness how he manages to open up to them. Beyond this, Oher’s coach manages to give a convincing, poignant speech to sway the authorities in Oher’s favor. In real life, though, it was a little more complicated than that. His coach did advocate for him, yes, but he had to complete some rigorous academic assignments before he could be officially admitted. How else did this movie veer from reality?","16. The Truth Comes Out","Michael Oher did everything possible to correct the errors that were made in the film. To do this, in 2011 he penned an autobiography titled I Beat the Odds: From Homelessness, to The Blind Side, and Beyond.","Harry How/Getty Images","In it, he gives a more thorough look into his childhood and corrected any misconceptions the film made about him. He also expanded upon a number of stories he felt the film left unresolved and provided much more information than the movie ever could.","17. The Real Collins Tuohy","One character fans of the film loved was Michael’s lovely sister Collins Tuohy, portrayed by actress Lily Collins. The film portrays her to be quite the high achiever herself as a cheerleader and a member of the volleyball team.","Leigh Anne Tuohy","As it turns out, Collins Tuohy was, in fact, quite talented in several areas. Not only did she end up becoming a cheerleader at Ole Miss, she also was a state champion in the sport of pole-vaulting while in high school. Like her adoptive brother, she went on to attend Ole Miss.","18. When Michael Met Sean","As is becoming clear, what we see on the screen is not always what really happened. One such scene involves the moment Sean Tuohy meets Michael Oher. As moving as this scene might have been, it too underwent heavy creative tweaking.","Aceshowbiz","In the film, Tuohy first meets Oher unexpectedly at one of Collins’ volleyball games. At the game, Oher is cleaning up the debris left behind by hungry spectators. In reality, Tuohy first visited Oher at his school. He dropped in to make sure that Oher’s lunch money had processed, in order to ensure that Oher would not go hungry at school.","19. Mighty Preparation for a Mighty Role","As tough as Quinton Aaron was at the time, there was still plenty of work to do to get him to the top of his physical game. To do this, he trained with a real, top-notch college football team in order to really get into the role.","Closer Weekly","The football team at Georgia Tech welcomed Quinton Aaron aboard so that he could train for the role. For this incredible role, getting to know the field was as important as knowing the fellow actors and actresses.","20. Doubts from Briarcrest","Authorities at Briarcrest Christian School were less than enthused about the name of the school being used in the film. Even though, the name of the school in the movie was changed Wingate Christian School, they worried that the movie would still sour the school’s reputation because the teachers were shown to dismiss Michael Oher’s academic abilities in the film.","News – The Commercial Appeal","As fans know, the school was still represented fully in the film. Director John Lee Hancock was even sure to remember one subtle detail: the school’s color, green, prominently displayed throughout the film. In the end, the film did not dishonor the school in any way and simply relayed information vital to the plot’s progression.","21. Firsts for Quinton Aaron","Playing Michael Oher ended up introducing the starry-eyed Quinton Aaron to a life he never knew before. Not only would he play the leading role in an Oscar-nominated film, he would enjoy the glitzy life that came with such an honor.","The Hollywood Reporter","Before he accepted the role, Quinton Aaron had never flown on an airplane in his life. He would get to experience that when he returned for the second audition for the part. At that time, he would get to experience another first: visiting the sparkling city of Los Angeles.","22. Pushed Along","Supportive parents can be a real blessing. Quinton Aaron learned that quickly, as he might not have even gotten the chance to try out for the part as Michael Oher if it had not been for his doting mother.","TheBlaze","Aaron’s mother saw the call for the role and instantly thought of her very own son. She read the description of what they were looking for, noted the towering size requirement, and knew instantly that the part was made for Aaron. Thus, she submitted his name for him, hoping that good news would come to her and her son.","23. Determined to Make It Work","Intense training, lots of practice, and more. That is what it took Quinton Aaron to ready himself to play a convincing Michael Oher on the big screen. But what exactly did “more” entail?","coed.com","The young actor soon found himself embarking on a weight loss journey. In total, he lost 100 pounds in order to get in shape for the role. But Aaron considered that a small price to pay for such a great opportunity. In fact, he said he would have “done anything” to prove he was still fit for the part. Thus, he shed a significant portion of his body weight over the course of just three months.","24. Sean Tuohy","To some, Sean Tuohy in the movie might look pretty familiar — especially if those people are fans of country music. That is because the actor portraying him is none other than the country music sensation Tim McGraw. Who knew that he had a flair for acting as well?","Country 102.5","As it turns out, Tim McGraw is not the only musical soul on set. You probably recognized another famous last name from the music world: Lily Collins. That is because Lily Collins is actually Phil Collins’s daughter–yes, Genesis’ Phil Collins, by the way.","25. Sandra Bullock’s Biggest Break Yet","Sandra Bullock was no nobody when she appeared in The Blind Side. The actress already had plenty of credits to her name. She had starred in Speed alongside Keanu Reeves. In fact, she starred in another fairly-commercially-successful film the same year The Blind Side hit theaters: a rom-com entitled The Proposal.","kinopoisk.ru","But The Blind Side brought Sandra Bullock more than just an overwhelming amount of critical acclaim and some major awards. She also got to see a record be broken. For the first time ever, an actress would have the spotlight to herself. Bullock’s name was the only woman’s name legible above the film’s title, and the film grossed over $200 million at the box office.","26. A Legacy for a Champion","Many people enjoyed The Blind Side, from the casual moviegoing public to even the most serious of critics. The film not only made a name for itself at prestigious award events like the Golden Globes and the Oscars. And not only was the film a major milestone in Sandra Bullock’s career. It also broke a significant record at the box office.","Washington Post","The Blind Side came into existence on a relatively modest budget of just under $30 million. It ended up bringing in way more than that: a staggering $309.2 million, to be exact. As a result of its enormous profit, the film has gone on to claim the title as the highest grossing sports film of all time.","27. Picture Perfect","One of the most memorable moments of the film is the Thanksgiving scene. The Tuohy family gather at a crowded table in a warm house to share an abundant meal. Everything appears to be ideal, right down to the turkey bronzed in soft glow. If you look closer, you might notice something.","YouTube","Well, at least, the art buffs were quick to notice this subtle detail. When Leigh Anne went to set down the turkey, the scene suddenly transformed into a replica of the famous painting by Norman Rockwell entitled “Freedom from Want.” This may or may not have been intentional. In any case, the nice moment definitely captured the palpable moment of family togetherness.","28. Devoted to Good Ol’ Ole Miss","The Ole Miss spirit is alive and well in this film, of course. After all, the University of Mississippi happens to be the alma mater of Collins Tuohy, Michael Oher, and Leigh Anne Tuohy. Any college football family would envy such a proud lineage.","Saturday Down South","As it happens, though, this is not the first time Sandra Bullock portrayed an Ole Miss alumni. In 1996, the illustrious actress starred in the well-received drama A Time To Kill. Her character, Ellen Roark, a passionate law student, had also attended Ole Miss as an undergraduate student.","29. The Book that Inspired It All","It’s pretty safe to say that Quinton Aaron does an excellent job portraying “Big Mike”, but what was real, and what was fiction? Much of the film was inspired by a book written by Michael Lewis, entitled The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.","NYMag","Michael was only one part of the book’s storyline. The written version of The Blind Side actually told the story of the lives and careers of someone other than Michael Oher. It also chronicled the life of Lawrence Taylor, who played for the New York Giants from 1981 to 1993.","30. Close to Reality","Sport fans definitely noticed familiar faces in the movie, especially regarding the coaches. That’s because many of the coaches portrayed are actual current or past football coaches. For example, Houston Nutt plays the coach for the University of Mississippi in the movie. In reality, he used to be the coach for the University of Arkansas.","Pinterest","Other examples include Ed Orgeron, who now coaches the Louisiana State University team after a long stint at Ole Miss. Another coach in the film was Phillip Fulmer, who once served as football coach for the University of Tennessee.","31. Memphis in Georgia?","As fans of the movie know, the film takes place in Memphis, Tenn. It is also where the real life story of Michael Oher took place and in the movie, Leigh Anne says , “I have been in Memphis my whole life.” But viewers with a careful eye might have noticed something else in the background.","doblu.com","In one of the scenes, Leigh Anne and Michael walk past a sign that says “Georgia Lottery PLAY HERE” while at the Big and Tall store. Strange…Memphis is definitely not in Georgia! It turns out that the movie was filmed in Atlanta Georgia.","32. Pay Day","Sandra Bullock was at first extremely hesitant to take on the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy, for religious reasons. However, once she met the real-life woman, Bullock wanted the role so bad that she even agreed to a pay cut to play the role.","infilead.com","Apparently, Sandra Bullock (and likely most Hollywood stars) ask for a set fee to star in a film, which this film couldn’t offer. The alternative was to offer her a percentage of the profits. She agreed and it turned out to be quite profitable since the film earned $309.2 million in theaters.","33. Football Fandom","The Blind Side is filled with plenty of special cameos and one fascinating person that made an appearance was Michael Oher’s real-life high school football coach from Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Hugh Freeze. Where can you spot him in the movie?","Wesley Hitt/Getty Images","His time to shine on the big screen happens when he plays a University of Arkansas assistant, standing behind the real-life Arkansas Razorbacks coach, Houston Nutt. At the time, Freeze was no longer the Briarcrest coach but had moved on to Tennessee’s Lambuth University, where he served as the head coach of the football team until switching to Arkansas State in 2010.","34. Wonderbar Blind Side","Before a film is released, it is often only known by its working title. Sometimes this working title is also used when copies of the movie are sent to theaters. Apparently, this is done in order to disguise the identities of highly-anticipated movies.","Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images","In the case of The Blind Side, movie theaters didn’t know it by its current title. Rather, the 35mm print was given the very vague title of Wonderbar. The word “wunderbar” in German means “wonderful” in English. Were they already anticipating the film’s success?","35. Family Cameo","Actual people involved in the story of Michael Oher made several cameos in The Blind Side and in one case, it was made by one of the real members of the Tuohy family. The cameo wasn’t big but it is definitely interesting.","thescore.com","In the movie, during a scene showing the first game, the real S.J. Tuohy is spotted right next to Tim McGraw, who was playing S.J.’s father, Sean Tuohy. After high school, the now-24-year-old S.J. went on to study and play football at Loyola University in Baltimore and is currently a football coach at Southern Methodist University.","36. Waterloo Whoops!","In The Blind Side, Michael Oher is told he must improve his grades and academic level in order to be accepted to the fictional Wingate Christian School. In one of the scenes, Michael is shown taking a history test, but something is very odd.","IMDb","In this scene, the camera shows a question about the Battle of Waterloo and where it happened. At the top of the page, it is clear to see that Michael answered that it took place in Germany and the teacher marked this answer as the correct one. In reality, it took place in what was then The Netherlands and now Belgium.","37. Timeline Troubles","When a movie is filmed so soon after something takes place, it may seem that everything has stayed the same in the world. For that reason, a few details managed to get overlooked. One example was in the scene at the recruiting office.","alchetron.com","During this scene, Tom Lemming is given a DVD of Michael Oher, which is resting atop a magazine with football player Bryce Brown on the cover, showing him playing in the Army All-American game of 2009. However, The Blind Side takes place in 2003 and 2004 and back then, Bryce Brown was only 12 and 13.","38. Date Discrepencies","A few more time discrepancies are in the film, aside from the one involving Bryce Brown. As mentioned, the movie is set in 2003 and 2004 and some things were not available then. For example, in the movie, Sean Tuohy is shown using the Safari browser on a Windows operating system. However, this only became available in 2007.","Pinterest","Another example is with the particular type of car that Leigh Anne Tuohy drives, a BMW 750LI, which only came out in 2006. Making the discrepancy even more apparent is that this car model underwent a facelift in 2006 and looked quite different from the versions available in 2003 and 2004.","39. No Privacy","Viewers with knowledge of privacy laws probably noticed something a bit strange in The Blind Side. Leigh Anne, who had not legally adopted Michael Oher yet, was given access to his files at his school in order to monitor his progress.","newsok.com","In real life, a student’s files are considered confidential and only legal guardians or those with power of attorney are provided access to these. Nonetheless, we see the social worker at Wingate Christian School providing Leigh Anne with all this information.","40. Southern Charmers","The Blind Side is not just a sports film. It’s also a very Southern film! It turns out that the film’s stars actually are southerners themselves. Sandra Bullock, who played Leigh Anne Tuohy, was born in Virginia and went to high school there (her family spent 12 years in Germany in between). She went to East Carolina University in North Carolina.","listal.com","Meanwhile, playing Sandra Bullock’s on-screen husband was Tim McGraw. He was born and raised in Louisiana and is best known for being one of the biggest musicians in Country music. He has released 14 albums and 10 of those have reached the No. 1 spot on the Country music charts.","Enjoyed our list?

Now Scientists Know Why.","targetDescription":"Scientists discovered a previously unidentified genetic mutation in a Scottish woman. They hope it could lead to the development of new pain treatment.","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["Advertisement","Supported by","By Heather Murphy","She’d been told that childbirth was going to be painful. But as the hours wore on, nothing bothered her — even without an epidural.","“I could feel that my body was changing, but it didn’t hurt me,” recalled the woman, Jo Cameron, who is now 71. She likened it to “a tickle.” Later, she would tell prospective mothers, “Don’t worry, it’s not as bad as people say it is.”","It was only recently — more than four decades later — that she learned her friends were not exaggerating.","Rather, there was something different about the way her body experienced pain: For the most part, it didn’t.","Scientists believe they now understand why. In a paper published Thursday in The British Journal of Anaesthesia, researchers attributed Ms. Cameron’s virtually pain-free life to a mutation in a previously unidentified gene. The hope, they say, is that the finding could eventually contribute to the development of a novel pain treatment. They believe this mutation may also be connected to why Ms. Cameron has felt little anxiety or fear throughout her life and why her body heals quickly.","“We’ve never come across a patient like this,” said John Wood, the head of the Molecular Nociception Group at University College London.","[Read more about how pain tolerance and anxiety may be connected.]","Scientists have been documenting case studies of individuals who experience little or no pain for nearly 100 years. But the genetic mutation that seems to be responsible for Ms. Cameron’s virtual painlessness had not been previously identified.","The study emerged amid major developments in the emotionally charged debate over how to responsibly treat pain. On Thursday, New York State filed one of the most sweeping legal cases yet against the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid OxyContin.","And it was yet another reminder that we need less addictive alternatives for chronic pain, said Dr. Stephen G. Waxman, a neurologist at Yale and the author of “Chasing Men on Fire: The Story of the Search for a Pain Gene.” Dr. Waxman was not involved in the recent paper but he also studies people who have rare mutations that alter their experience of pain.","“Each of these mutations teach us something, and point to a particular gene as a potential target for new and more effective pain medications,” he said.","‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾","Earlier reporting on medical mysteries","• Congratulations, It’s Twins. The Doctor Is Perplexed.","• It Looked Like a Beer Belly. It Turned Out He Had a 77-Pound Tumor.","• When the Illness Is a Mystery, Patients Turn to These Detectives","‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾","The sequence of events that led scientists to investigate Ms. Cameron’s genes began about five years ago. She was living a happy, ordinary life on the banks of Loch Ness in Scotland with her husband, she said. After a hand operation, a doctor seemed perplexed that she was not experiencing any pain and did not want painkillers.","“I guarantee I won’t need anything,” Ms. Cameron recalled telling Dr. Devjit Srivastava, a consultant in anesthesia and pain medicine at a National Health Service hospital in northern Scotland and one of the authors of the paper.","A few follow-up questions revealed that Ms. Cameron was unusual. At 65, she’d needed to have her hip replaced. Because it had not caused her pain, she had not noticed anything was amiss until it was severely degenerated. Cuts, burns, fractures — these did not hurt either. In fact, it often took the smell of burning flesh or her husband identifying blood for her to notice something wrong. She also reported that eating Scotch bonnet chili peppers left only a “pleasant glow.”","Dr. Srivastava referred her to University College London’s Molecular Nociception Group, a team focused on genetic approaches to understanding the biology of pain and touch. They had some clues for her. In recent decades, scientists have identified dozens of other people who process pain in unusual ways. But when Dr. James Cox, a senior lecturer with that group and another author of the new paper, inspected her genetic profile, it did not resemble that of others known to live without pain.","Eventually he found what he was looking for on a gene the scientists call FAAH-OUT. All of us have this gene. But in Ms. Cameron’s, “the patient has a deletion that removes the front of the gene,” he said. Additional blood work confirmed this hypothesis, he said.","Ms. Cameron said she had been shocked by the interest in her case. Until her conversation with Dr. Srivastava, pain was not something she thought about. Perhaps it helped that even though she burned and cut herself quite often, her injuries rarely left scars — something else that scientists believe is connected to the mutation.","[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]","A number of articles have been written about parents of children with similar conditions. Many live in fear that without pain, their children won’t learn how to avoid hurting themselves. Her parents never made it an issue, she said. She suspects this may be because she inherited the mutation from her father.","“I can’t remember him needing any painkillers,” she said. “I think that’s why I didn’t find it odd.”","Unfortunately, because he died before the discovery, it will remain unknown whether he carried the mutation. Her mother does not share it. Neither does her daughter. Her son “has the same microdeletion in FAAH-OUT, but does not have the other mutation that confers reduced FAAH function,” Dr. Cox said.","In other words, her son shares some, but not all, of her pain insensitivity.","Scientists are also intrigued by Ms. Cameron’s extraordinarily low anxiety level. On an anxiety disorder questionnaire, she scored zero out of 21. She cannot recall ever having felt depressed or scared.","“I am very happy,” she said.","In retrospect, she sees how her genetic disposition may have aided her at work. After years as a primary-school teacher, she retrained to work with people with severe mental disabilities. Erratic, aggressive behavior never riled her, she said.","But though having this mutation may sound like a dream, there are downsides. One is that she is quite forgetful; prone to losing her keys and her train of thought midsentence. The other is that she’s never felt the “adrenaline rush” that other people talk about, she said.","The researchers said they would now focus on trying to better understand how FAAH-OUT works so that they can design a gene therapy or other pain intervention around it. Turning a discovery of this sort into an actual pain or anxiety treatment requires many steps, many years and many millions of dollars. It’s rare for a product to emerge.","But it’s not unprecedented, Dr. Waxman said. As a reminder of how an individual with an unusual genetic makeup can shape the future of medicine, he pointed to statin drugs.","“They were developed largely on the basis and discovery of incredibly rare families where everyone was having heart attacks in their 20s,” he said. Whether it will be Ms. Cameron’s mutation or another individual’s mutation that directs the future of painkillers, it’s too early to say.","“But I’m reasonably confident that the lessons we are learning from the genes involved in pain will lead to the development of an entirely new class of pain medications,” he said.","Related Coverage","How Pain Tolerance and Anxiety Seem to Be Connected","New York Sues Sackler Family Members and Drug Distributors","The Hazards of Growing Up Painlessly","Advertisement","Site Index","news","opinion","arts","living","more","Subscribe","Site Information Navigation"],"targetCaptions":[]}

","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["Since the 1980s hundreds of phones featuring the likeness of our favourite Monday-hatin’ cat washed up in France and no one knew why.","Photo via Ar Viltansou’s Facebook page.","For years, France has had a Garfield problem.","Phones made in the likeness of everyone’s favourite Monday-hatin’, lasagna-lovin’ cat would continually invade the shores of Brittany, a region in northwest France. Year in, year out, when people would set out to clean the glorious French beaches on the coast there would be our favourite orange feline staring up at them, mocking them with his cold dead eyes.","Since the 1980s, when Garfield-mania was really getting going, the phones have been coming in. And it’s not like they’re coming in at a small rate. According to FranceInfo, last year alone saw almost 200 of the phones wash up on the beaches.","It was like the ocean wanted to give the kind people of France a gift, and Poseidon just straight up loved kitschy shit from the 80s.","The phones are probably what you think of when you picture a ‘novelty Garfield phone.’ They feature our lovely boy lounging on the ground and you lift the phone straight out of his back. To make it even more fun, the designers incorporated Garfield’s famous laziness, as his eyes only open when you pick up the phone—possibly out of the horror and pain which comes when you remove a portion of a creature’s back. Now, the phones don’t always come in whole-hog, sometimes you would just get Garfield's head, sometimes just his body or the phone from the back, or sometimes even just the cord but they would all be that familiar colour of orange.","The Garfield garbage was so ubiquitous in this area of France that some environmental groups started using him as almost a mascot to show how polluted our oceans were becoming.","As to where this pollution was coming from, well, there were a lot of theories of varying quality—I gotta assume at least one person thought that aliens dropped off these phones to fuck with residents. The prevailing wisdom was that the phones were leaking from a shipping container or ship that had sank, and over the years was slowly letting its cargo out. Claire Simonin-Le Meur, president of the environmental group Ar Viltansoù, told the  Washington Post that if this was the case her group was worried the plastic from the phones would pollute the ocean. Her group therefore did whatever they could to find it—including enlisting the help from gosh-darn submarines.","“We were looking for it, but we had no precise idea of where it could be,” Simonin-Le Meur said. “We thought it was under the sea. We asked people who were divers to look for it. We get a lot of submarines in the area too—it’s a military area. But they said it was not possible the container could be there and nobody saw it.”","Then last week, after some publicity around the mystery, a local farmer with a tale to tell found Simonin-Le Meur as she was cleaning up a beach. This farmer asked her if she was looking for Garfield, and when she replied yes, he told her, according to the  Washington Post, “Come with me. I can show you.”","The man told Simonin-Le Meur about a massive 1980s storm that ripped through the area and, out of the freakin’ blue, Garfield shit appeared fort the first time. The farmer and his brother were understandably curious at the phenomenon, and went exploring up and down the coast. As they did they came across a cave cut into the rocky shoreline. The two ventured inside and, lo and behold, dangerously deep in the bowels of the cave the brothers found a shipping container stuffed full of shit, including a massive amount of Garfield phones. Now, while sometimes accessible, this cave would be submerged during high tide, which is when the Garfield phones would leak out. He showed Simonin-Le Meur the cave but sadly it was high tide and the two couldn’t go in.","Not to be deterred, Simonin-Le Meur got herself a team together, invited some journalists, and when the tide was low they went searching for the shipping container. It wasn’t long until they found it. Sadly, while they won the battle, it seems they had lost the war, as the Garfield phones were almost entirely gone, taken by the sea.","“I saw Garfield and container pieces all over the cave,” Simonin-Le Meur said to  Le Monde. “But the bulk of the phones are already gone, the sea has done its job for thirty years.”","So, out there in the tides are Garfield phones floating around waiting for their turn to wash up on the shoreline. While we now know where they came from, we can’t stop the inevitable Garfield invasion of France.","Just goes to show you can’t keep a good cat down.","Sign up for the VICE Canada Newsletter   to get the best of VICE Canada delivered to your inbox.","Follow Mack Lamoureux on  Twitter .","VICE Canada has a Newsletter.","Sign up now to get the best of VICE Canada delivered straight to your inbox"],"targetCaptions":[]}

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. For an explanation of our Advertising Policy, visit this page.","With tax season upon us and a new tax law in use, many Americans are anxious to know what it will mean for their tax payments — and refunds. The good news is that two-thirds of Americans can expect to pay less for the 2018 fiscal year in taxes, but the bad news is that might not translate to a bigger refund, according to The Wall Street Journal.","Tax returns vary state to state and person to person, but past data and future estimates can still give taxpayers a sense of what they’ll be forking over to the IRS come April. Using data from Smart Asset on average tax refunds per state, we’ve come up with trip ideas for the most common tax refund amounts. And really, what better way to celebrate spring (and the end of tax season) than with a trip paid for in full with a tax refund?","You can use sites like Jauntaroo and Wander to input the type of vacation you’re dreaming of (adventure or cultural; city or rural) and your individual per-person budget. Even with a smaller refund, you’ll be surprised how far it can take you.","$2,400 to $2,550","With a more modest tax refund, visitors can still plan an awesome trip, either domestically or abroad. The lowest tax refund is, typically, in Maine, where the average tax payer sees a refund of $2,460. But that money could send a solo traveler to Cartagena, Colombia (we found flights for $743 in May) or Berlin, Germany, for a week or longer (flights may use about half your budget, starting at $1,110). Those looking to travel domestically could take a full two weeks to visit the Pacific Northwest (think: Seattle, Portland and the surrounding area for under $500 roundtrip) or to the islands of Hawaii.","Couples can spend a week in Sedona, Arizona hiking the red rocks, or lounge on the beach in Florida’s Key West, with airfares in the low $300s roundtrip from many East Coast airports, according to Jauntaroo.","International destinations are still a possibility for couples on a $2,400 budget, including getaways to Croatia, where roundtrip airfare can be found from $483 per person and hotels can be booked for less than $100 per night. (Sadly, outside the capital, there aren’t a ton of points hotel options.) There’s also Budapest, Hungary. Hunt for a roundtrip flight just over $400 and boutique apartment rentals for $60 per night on Airbnb.","$2,700 to $2,850","Much of the Midwest falls into this range of tax refunds, including Minnesota, Ohio and Michigan, according to Smart Asset. Residents in these states can escape still-chilly temperatures with trips to sunny and beautiful destinations all across the US — especially cities with some of the best art, culture and food scenes. For a lower-budget trip, US residents can head to New Orleans (fly Spirit and you could go for under $200 from major Midwest airports) to sample alligator sausage and listen to hot jazz or to Charleston (we found flights costing between $260 and $420 in May, depending on your departure airport) for contemporary Southern cuisine and charming colonial architecture.","For international vacations, Midwest residents can head to Spain from the Midwest for just $481 roundtrip per person, or take a quick flight to the island of Aruba for just $371, according to Skyscanner. Entire families can enjoy a trip here by using points to reserve a stay at one of the island’s many great points properties.","$3,000 to $3,150","The average tax refund has historically been about $3,000 per person, and most states land in this range, from Alaska to Georgia, Maryland and Nevada. It’s still a sizable refund, and even travelers who don’t want to spend their entire tax refund on a trip can find great options within this budget.","For residents of Nevada, Alaska, or any of the other western states, the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington are a short flight and boat ride away. The rural archipelago is filled with state parks and greenery, making it the perfect option for nature lovers who want to hike, kayak, swim or watch for orcas starting in May. Flights originating from the west can be as low as $103 per person, according to Skyscanner, and hotels on the islands usually run from $70 to $150 per night.","For international locations, residents of the West Coast can fly to parts of South America in just a few hours. Flights from California to Sao Paulo, Brazil are usually less than $500 in May. East Coast residents can turn to the British Isles for a great getaway, where flights to Scotland are $499 round trip and flights to London are just $341, according to Skyscanner. Travelers can splurge on the recently renovated Ritz-Carlton in London, or stay at the highly rated Hilton Metropole for less than $150 per night. (Cash in your points for an award night, and you’ll have plenty of your tax return left over for food, beverages and activities.)","$3,700 to $3,850","States in the Northeast see some of the highest average tax refunds, with Connecticut taking the number one spot of $3,844, according to Smart Asset. Travelers could jet off to Bali for two weeks to visit ancient Hindu temples. Flights from New York City to Bali can get as low as $481 roundtrip in the month of May (though if you want to book something quick, it’s not difficult to find flights in the mid-$700s) and hotels run in the low hundreds per night.","North African temperatures tend to be relatively mild in the spring, making it a great time to visit Morocco or Egypt (one of our top places to travel this April). Flights to Africa tend to run on the more expensive side, regardless of the time of year, but flights to Casablanca can be found in the low $600s roundtrip. Visitors can rent entire homes near Casablanca for roughly $50 per night — and some even include their own pools.","This story has been edited to clarify that it refers to tax refunds, not tax returns.","For the latest travel news, deals and points and miles tips please subscribe to The Points Guy daily email newsletter.","Feature image by spxChrome / Getty Images.","Share this:","News and deals straight to your inbox every day.","NEW INCREASED OFFER: 60,000 Points","TPG'S BONUS VALUATION: $1,200","CARD HIGHLIGHTS: 2X points on all travel and dining, points transferrable to over a dozen travel partners","Editorial Disclaimer: Opinions expressed here are the author’s alone, not those of any bank, credit card issuer, airlines or hotel chain, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities.","Disclaimer: The responses below are not provided or commissioned by the bank advertiser.

But King was also a two-term governor of the Bank of England, the person responsible for translating the last Labour government's plan for an independent Bank of England into a fixture of the financial landscape and an economist of the highest order.","His successor Mark Carney, criticised by Brexiteers for being a traitor for his Remain views, has, to his credit, been more prepared for Brexit than anyone in Whitehall.","Protests erupted last night, as Britain should have left the EU. The sticking point has been the deal and no deal Brexit is judged to be off the table but should we be that worried about it?","The Bank prepared a fat dossier on the potential impact of Brexit on the City, Britain's biggest overseas earner, only to see it gather dust in Whitehall.","Once Carney managed to capture the attention of Westminster he was able to resolve one of the biggest threats to the original March 29 deadline – the fate of £41 billion of derivatives contracts.","The current governor also forged a transatlantic derivatives deal and started to make the case for supranational leadership of the global economy.","In his BBC interview, King was critical of the Chancellor for delaying No Deal preparations until it was too late. We know that Britain's best-run companies, some of our European trading partners and the financial community have not been so foolish.","The world's biggest asset manager, Blackrock, had booked plane tickets to New York for a group of senior staff to make sure that investors did not suffer if an exit on March 29 turned out to be hugely disruptive to trading.","RELATED ARTICLES","Share this article","HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP","One of Germany's biggest northern ports, Bremerhaven, has worked overtime to make sure exports of Volkswagen cars and parts can be smoothly shipped to Britain irrespective of customs arrangements. Astrazeneca set up an alternate production line for its prostate cancer medicines in Sweden, just in case of supply problems in the UK.","Toyota, the world's biggest car maker, plans for production in the UK and there is intense speculation that BMW, far from shifting Mini production to Germany, wants to buy some of the Honda facilities in Swindon when it ships back to Japan in 2020.","This is not fantasy economics.

But if the representative business groups, such as the British Chambers of Commerce, spent less time publicly groaning about 'corrosive damage' and more time assisting members with preparations then the landing might not be so bumpy.","King also reiterated a basic truth about the EU and the eurozone. It is far from being a perfect market of 500m, as has so often been claimed.","Greece remains an economic basket case where one quarter of output has been wiped out. Italy has seen no increase in its output for 20 years.","The monetary union, in King's view, has been 'disastrous', and he notes that the British economy has done better than Germany's since the referendum and is still doing so. Diplomacy teaches us that unilateral actions rarely work smoothly, so the unloved Theresa May deal (even with a £39 billion bill) remains the sound option in spite of a partial third defeat.","But as King reiterates, there is no reason to fear the kind of well-prepared No Deal that large swathes of corporate Britain and parts of Europe have been planning for.","Even by US hype standards this is a Lyft off","American brokers and investment bankers are masters of hype.","Before the ride-service Lyft offer, the last tech initial public offering to hit Wall Street was social media site Snap.","The stock soared 44 per cent on its first day of trading. Two years later the shares are trading at just above $10 against a float price of $17 per share.","Lyft's early trades were 20 per cent above the IPO price.","With a queue of other tech floats waiting to follow – including Uber – there was reason not to oversell Lyft, which has never made a profit.","Worryingly, Lyft founders Logan Green and John Zimmer learnt nothing about governance from previous tech floats. They will have 20 votes for each share they hold, against just one for everyone else, giving them 49 per cent control.","Silicon Valley finds it hard to ditch a controversial structure.","Sort your pension or Isa before it's too late","Brexit didn't happen on March 29th, as it should have done, but one event set in stone each year is the end of the financial year.","That happens on 5 April, and it means the clock is ticking if you haven't sorted your Isa or pension.","Editor Simon Lambert, assistant editor Lee Boyce and host Georgie Frost have a tax-beating special podcast looking at cash and investing Isas, pensions and more for your ears .","Press play to listen to this week's full episode on the player above, or listen (and please subscribe and review us if you like the podcast) at Apple Podcasts, Acast, Audioboom and Spotify or visit our This is Money Podcast page.","Share or comment on this article:","Comments 509","Share what you think","The comments below have not been moderated.","The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.","Add your comment","By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.","Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?","Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.","Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?","Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual","We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

With those numbers, Powers writes that the Blackhawks are most likely going to get DeBrincat to eventually sign a six-year deal, likely heading into the $8MM AAV-range, pointing out that a seven or eight-year deal is unlikely since a six-year deal will leave him looking for a third contract at age 27, the perfect age for a long-term extension. If he can continue posting 30-to-40 goal seasons, DeBrincat could be in line for double digit cap hits in the future.","As for Strome, the team may be better off waiting for another year to lock up the young forward. Strome has played well in Chicago with 14 goals and 45 points in 53 games, but both sides would be better off to wait another year for more proof that he deserves a big contract extension. Plus, it would be wise if Chicago doesn’t have two big contracts handed out in the same year, which could get expensive, possibly between $13-15MM combined.","Alex DeBrincat| Ben Bishop| Chicago Blackhawks| Dallas Stars| Dan Hamhuis| Dante Fabbro| Dylan Strome| Injury| Jimmy Schuldt| Mats Zuccarello| Minnesota Wild| Nashville Predators| Nick Schmaltz| Troy Grosenick","Comments","SuperSinker","17 hours ago","Come join Poehling and Lindgren Schuldt!","Leave a Reply Cancel reply","Please login to leave a reply.

In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons, MPs voted by 344 to 286 against the deal as hundreds of protesters staged a noisy demonstration outside on the day when the UK was due to leave the European Union.   Some 34 Conservative rebels ignored a last-ditch plea from the Prime Minister to take \"the last opportunity to guarantee Brexit\" and consigned her deal to its third humiliating defeat.   The result of the crunch vote means that the UK has missed an EU deadline to secure an extension of the Brexit process and leave with a deal on May 22.   Mrs May now has until April 12 to go back to Brussels with new proposals and seek a longer extension to the negotiation process, or see the UK leave without a deal that day.   With a clear majority in the Commons against no-deal, and with MPs once more seizing control of the timetable on Monday, Mrs May said the UK would have to find \"an alternative way forward\".   This was \"almost certain\" to involve the UK having to stage elections to the European Parliament in May, she said.","Mrs May said that the outcome was \"a matter of profound regret\".   Despite the setback, Downing St said it was not an \"inevitability\" that the UK would have to participate in the European elections and made clear she would continue to fight for her deal.   After defeats of 230 and 149 in the previous two Commons votes, a No 10 source said they were \"at least going in the right direction\".   \"We continue to believe that the deal the PM has negotiated is the best outcome for the country and we will continue to seek a way forward,\" the source said.   European Council president Donald Tusk called an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels on April 10 to discuss the implications of the vote.   Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election unless the Prime Minister was willing to find an alternative deal.   And Mrs May - who had promised to step down as Prime Minister if her deal was approved - appeared to hint that this was a possibility, telling MPs: \"I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House.\"   She said: \"This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table.   \"And today it has rejected approving the Withdrawal Agreement alone and continuing a process on the future.   \"This Government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands.\"","Mr Corbyn told MPs: \"The House has been clear this deal now has to change, there has to be an alternative found.   \"And if the Prime Minister can't accept that then she must go - not at an indeterminate date in the future but now, so that we can decide the future of this country through a general election.\"   The fate of Mrs May's deal was sealed as 34 Conservative MPs went through the No lobby, while only five Labour MPs voted with the Prime Minister.   The number of Tory rebels was fewer than half the 75 who opposed the deal in the Meaningful Vote of March 12 but enough to overturn the result had they voted the other way.","Among rebels were hardline Brexiteers including Mr Baker, Sir Bill Cash, Priti Patel, Owen Paterson and Sir John Redwood, along with supporters of a softer deal like Dominic Grieve, Justine Greening and Sam Gyimah.   Labour MPs backing the deal were Kevin Barron, Rosie Cooper, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint and John Mann, along with the party's former MPs Frank Field and Ian Austin, now sitting as independents.   DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said Mrs May had missed \"numerous\" opportunities to remedy the \"deficiencies\" in proposed backstop arrangements for the Irish border, which made the deal unacceptable to his party.   \"Over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to play a central role to chart a route that respects the democratic desire to leave the European Union but that does so in a way that strengthens our United Kingdom,\" said Mr Dodds.","Follow us"],"targetCaptions":[]}

It...","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["Pete Buttigieg","Breaking News Emails","He was described as \"the longest of long shots\" when he decided to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, and for good reason.","He'd been the mayor of a city whose population, at barely 100,000, ranked 167th in America, falling somewhere between Cedar Rapids and Topeka. Outside of his hometown, almost no one had ever heard of him. \"It's ludicrous,\" one pundit sniffed.","But his party was desperate to reclaim the presidency and he was convinced that once they took a look at him, Democrats would see a winner — a progressive military veteran from a deeply conservative area running on a message of generational transformation.","Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana?","Nope.","Larry Agran from Irvine, California, the last candidate before Buttigieg to attempt the audacious leap from a midsize City Hall to the White House.","Agran ran in 1992, a generation ago, when the media ecosystem was far narrower and more constricting. To compare what he endured as a candidate then to what Buttigieg has already experienced now is to recognize just how drastically that ecosystem has been revolutionized — and what that revolution has made possible.","Two months after announcing his bid, Buttigieg has already attained something akin to political celebrity status, at least with a slice of the public.","There have been viral videos to go with gushing praise from elite cultural and political figures, appearances on marquee television shows and podcasts, an online fundraising windfall and a spark of life in the early polls. He's never won public office outside of South Bend, but nearly half of Democrats nationally now know Buttigieg's name, and even if his campaign falls short in the end, he's already succeeded in making himself a mainstream national figure.","Watching this all unfold from his home in Irvine, Agran can only marvel.","To call his '92 campaign \"forgotten\" would be a misnomer; few ever knew he was running in the first place. Dismissed by the gatekeeper class as a fringe character, he found himself shunned by television, barred from debates, cropped out of newspaper photos, and even — in an incident he still grows emotional recounting — handcuffed and arrested while trying to join his fellow primary candidates on stage in New York.","\"It's very, very painful to be excluded when you know you're worthy of inclusion,\" Agran, now 74, said in an interview last week. \"That sticks with you a long time, you know. There's a certain humiliation.\"","A very different climate","Democrats were confronting a leadership vacuum when Agran first got the idea to run. The party was on a losing streak, three straight national defeats and none of its heavyweights were eager to challenge President George H.W. Bush, who seemed invincible after the Gulf War triumph of early 1991.","Momentous global change was afoot, too. The Berlin Wall was down, the Soviet empire in collapse, and the Cold War over at last. A brand new set of challenges awaited the country, and there was a debate to be had about what the priorities should be. Agran wanted in on it.","At first, he tried to play a supporting role. Former Sen. George McGovern, who'd been the Democrats' 1972 nominee against Richard Nixon, was contemplating another bid, and Agran headed his exploratory committee. But when McGovern took a pass, Agran — like Buttigieg this year — found himself surveying the field and wondering: Why not me?","Against a roster of current and former senators and governors, he’d be the only mayor, an advocate for issues and ideas the other candidates weren't interested in touching. He could point to a record, six years as mayor battling developers and implementing landmark environmental ordinances in a city exploding with growth. That Irvine was a Republican town (and part of famously conservative Orange County) and that Agran had won elections there anyway might be another selling point.","He drew up a platform. The centerpiece was a \"peace dividend\" — radically slashing defense spending and using the money to deliver large payments directly to American cities. In August 1991, he held an event at the University of California-Irvine to announce his candidacy for president. \"America,\" Agran declared, \"can no longer afford the Cold War priorities of the 1980s.\"","South Bend mayor makes his case for 2020","Today, a campaign like Agran's would put videos from that speech on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets. They'd probably create a short, slick introductory video, too, aiming for viral attention. Buttigieg's 107-second announcement video, for example, has over a million views (and counting) just on his Twitter page. The online energy it generated when it was posted back in January led directly to broader media coverage of his candidacy.","But there was no social media in 1991, no internet to speak of, and only one cable news network (CNN, which was far less focused on politics than it is now). That left Agran at the mercy of a relative handful of media and political elites who could decide if he was worthy of attention on national television and in major national newspapers — and, critically, of a spot on the debate stage. Over and over again, their decision was no.","Again, the contrast to today is striking.","For the 2020 race, the Democratic National Committee has established specific and attainable criteria for inclusion in debates. Anyone who can hit 1 percent in several national polls or generate 65,000 small dollar donations can get on the stage. There's no question that Buttigieg, and probably more than a dozen others, will qualify, and the debates — all broadcast in prime time on national television — will be seen by millions of Americans.","Get on TV, or bust","When Agran ran, though, the standards were arbitrary. The chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party simply announced that \"as far as I’m concerned, he's a minor candidate,\" and left Agran out. \"That was the killer in the end,\" Agran recalled, \"when I was kept out of the debates.\"","Even when Agran caught a break, there wasn't much he could do with it. By far, his best media exposure came when PBS's \"MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour\" aired a 10-minute interview with him on a Friday night. It was well-received, with Agran's campaign getting dozens of calls from viewers who wanted to learn more. But with no social media to spread it around and build buzz, the interview vanished into the ether.","Agran remembers being at a small campaign event in someone's home and being asked why he was never on television.","\"I said, 'Does someone have a VCR here?'\" Someone did, and Agran played the tape of his MacNeil/Lehrer interview. \"And after they saw me on the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour, they erupted in applause, cheering the television. I'm standing right there — and they applaud the TV appearance! Which tells me, just confirmed, that unless you break through on TV, you just can't break through.\"","Flashback 1992: Larry Agran voter at New York Democratic Primary","Frustrated, Agran ultimately tried to force his way into the action. He crashed a candidate forum in New Hampshire hosted by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, standing in the audience, explaining his credentials and asking for a seat. When the audience rallied behind him, Rockefeller relented and Agran was given a seat with the other candidates. When he tried it again a few months later during a televised debate in New York, the response was different.","\"I stood up and said, 'Mr. Chairman, I'm Larry Agran. I'm a duly qualified candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. I'm on the New York State ballot. And I respectfully request inclusion in this debate.'","\"And just as I was making my pitch, police came charging up the stairs, down the aisle, grabbed me, and I repeated — while they were grabbing me — my request. And I was just dragged down the stairs headfirst, down two flights of stairs. And they arrested me, handcuffed me, put me in a police wagon.\"","While Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown debated inside that auditorium, Agran remained in custody. He was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest (\"The only resistance was my head hitting one stair after another — and it was the stairs that were providing the resistance\"), but the charges were ultimately dropped. He stayed in the race through the Democratic convention, collecting 58,000 votes nationally and three delegates — a fraction of the 10.5 million votes and nearly 3,400 delegates won by Clinton, who became the nominee and then unseated Bush that November.","A few years later, Joshua Meyrowitz, a professor of communication at the University of New Hampshire, used the Agran campaign as a case study to explore why some candidacies are taken seriously and others aren't. \"Agran's was a campaign that often came close to the threshold between minor and major,\" he wrote, \"but there was almost nothing he could do to cross it.\"","When his presidential campaign ended, Agran returned to Irvine, led an effort to create a national urban presidential primary, and then threw himself back into local politics, even winning back the mayoralty before losing re-election in 2014.","If he'd known what he was in for, Agran now says, he probably wouldn't have run for president. But he also says he's glad there's room now for a much wider assortment of candidates to be heard — including the mayor of a midsize city in northern Indiana.","Asked if the attention that's been showered on Buttigieg — the CNN town hall, the late-night TV appearances, the social media chatter — ever makes him think, That should have been me! Agran chuckled.","\"Oh, yeah, I've thought of that a number of times.\"","CORRECTION: (March 31, 2019, 10:08 a.m., ET): An earlier version of this article misstated Pete Buttigieg's political record. He ran unsuccessfully for Indiana state treasurer in 2010; it is not the case that has never run for office outside of South Bend, Indiana.","Steve Kornacki is a national political correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC.","© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The Borderlands 3 trailer gave fans their first look at the game’s four playable Vault Hunters, but Gearbox itself stopped short of providing specific details for the characters. However, thanks to past leaks that have since been corroborated by the Borderlands 3 PAX East trailer, we know some details anyway, including the name of the new melee-focused Siren.","The name of the melee-focused Siren seen in the Borderlands 3 trailer is Amara. This was originally revealed a couple of months ago through one of the various Borderlands 3 leaks that hit the internet well before the game was officially announced. Since other details in these leaks were confirmed by the Borderlands 3 reveal, we can safely assume that the Siren’s name is Amara. Of course, Gearbox may still end up changing it before officially naming the character and detailing her abilities itself, but that remains to be seen.","The leaks also give us a better idea of what kind of abilities Amara is bringing to the table. Assuming the leaks are correct, Amara will be similar to Brick from the first Borderlands, and will have a ground-pound attack and the Phaselock ability. Amara will also be able to project holograms that will be capable of attacking enemies, instead of just being used as decoys.","Again, it’s possible that this portion of the Borderlands 3 leaked information is inaccurate, but since everything else has been confirmed, it seems unlikely. Even so, we must still caution fans to take this news with a grain of salt until Gearbox itself offers specific details on the four playable characters.","Amara isn’t the only Siren that will be featured in Borderlands 3. On the contrary, fan favorite Sirens like Lilith and Maya will also be in the upcoming looter-shooter. Not only that, but the Borderlands 3 villains The Calypso Twins are also Sirens. Or at least, one is a Siren and the other is a male with Siren-like powers.","More details on the Sirens, villains, and Amara should come sooner rather than later. More information on Borderlands 3 is expected to come on April 3, so fans shouldn’t have to wait much longer.","Borderlands 3 is in development for unspecified platforms."],"targetCaptions":[]}

The iconic filmmaker loves his Facebook account, and regularly posts about current events and other things. And more times than not, his takes are the very definition of “hot.” So, you better believe people perked up and took notice when Schrader talked about Jordan Peele’s recent comments about white male leads.","READ MORE: Paul Schrader Talks Streaming Vs. Theaters & Explains Why He’s Happy Netflix Passed On ‘First Reformed’","For those that missed the big news, Peele recently spoke at an event and said that he didn’t see himself working with a white male lead in the future. He said, “I don’t see myself casting a white dude as the lead in my movie. Not that I don’t like white dudes, but I’ve seen that movie.”","Needless to say, given that it’s 2019 and every word a famous person says gets analyzed, especially if race is involved, the opinions about Peele’s statements were polarized. Well, Schrader decided to chime in and give his thoughts on the matter, and while the sentiment is there, his word choice is a bit…lacking.","The filmmaker wrote, “This makes sense. I’ve written or directed films with a black lead, an oriental lead, a female lead but my natural identification is with a certain type of white male. Peele at some point will find himself directing a white lead, not because of commerce but simply because that’s how art works.”","READ MORE: Paul Schrader Escapes Facebook Jail & Talks De Niro’s Desire For A ‘Taxi Driver’ Sequel: “Stupidest F–king Idea I’ve Ever Heard”","Of course, Schrader is an older gentleman and not aware that the term “oriental” is deemed as not appropriate. At least, let’s hope so. But otherwise, the filmmaker understands and empathizes with Peele, although he thinks that eventually, the “Get Out” filmmaker will have to eat those words.","We’ll just have to wait and see if Peele ends up regretting those words and uses a white male lead in the future. At this point, it appears the filmmaker is more than happy to spend his time producing films and creating projects that focus on whatever he wants. And right now, what he wants is to use Black leads.

It went on to gross $67.9 million domestically (adjusted). Ten years later, a television series spinoff also titled 10 Things I Hate About You aired on ABC Family.\n\nThe movie, which is a loose, modernized adaptation of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, was a breakout for both Ledger and Stiles when they were just starting out in their acting careers. The cast also included Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larry Miller.","In honor of the film's anniversary, The Hollywood Reporter takes a look at what the cast has been up to in the two decades since the rom-com first hit theaters. (Warning: Some spoilers if you haven't seen the movie.)","In his first American film, Ledger scored his breakout role as Patrick Verona, the bad-boy heartthrob who is paid to pursue Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) in a scheme concocted by a sophomore (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) so that he is able to pursue a date with Kat’s younger sister, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). When he first rose to fame in 1999, he was labeled as a “pretty boy” actor with little potential for deeper roles. Hollywood was proved wrong when he took on more serious roles in The Patriot; Brokeback Mountain, which earned him an Oscar nom; and The Dark Knight, for which he won a posthumous Oscar for his portrayal of the DC Universe villain The Joker. Ledger died Jan. 22, 2008, due to cardiac arrest following an accidental overdose of prescription medications that included painkillers, anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills.","Stiles played the rebellious, hard-headed Kat Stratford, who was hesitant to accept the affection of Patrick Verona. She eventually ends up falling in love with Patrick after a roller-coaster series of events, with the film ending in her own rendition of a Shakespearean sonnet titled 10 Things I Hate About You. Stiles went on to be in Save the Last Dance, Mona Lisa Smile, The Prince and Me and the Matt Damon Bourne movies.","Before 10 Things I Hate About You, Joseph Gordon-Levitt had an extensive resume as far as his acting career, including roles in Roseanne and That '70s Show. In the movie, Gordon-Levitt plays Cameron, a newcomer sophomore who has eyes for Kat’s younger sister, Bianca (Oleynik). When he discovers that Bianca’s father refuses to let her date before her older sister, Kat, Cameron pays Patrick (Ledger) to ask Kat on a date. Gordon-Levitt went on to play more memorable roles in films such as (500) Days of Summer, Inception and The Dark Knight Rises.","Oleynik landed her role as Bianca Stratford after she was in The Babysitter’s Club and played a minor role in Boy Meets World. Bianca is the temperamental younger sister of Kat who just wants the chance to date senior Joey Donner, who previously dated Kat. As the story progresses, she inevitably realizes that Joey is just another sleazy teenage guy and eventually falls for Cameron (Gordon-Levitt). Oleynik continued her acting career and later starred in another production with Gordon-Levitt, the TV series 3rd Rock From the Sun. More recently, she recurred on Mad Men and made a guest appearance on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.","In 10 Things I Hate About You, Keegan plays the malicious Joey Donner. When he loses his romantic grip on Bianca, he reveals to Kat the schemes of Cameron and Patrick. Before portraying Donner, he appeared in popular '90s shows Full House, Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Boy Meets World and had recurring roles in the television series Party of Five and 7th Heaven. His more recent credits include mostly guest appearances on various TV series.","Gabrielle Union played Chastity in 10 Things I Hate About You in 1999, the year that marked her big-screen debut with not only this film but another teen rom-com, She's All That (released Jan. 29, 1999). Previously, she had a recurring role in the TV series Sister, Sister. Union went on to appear in other '90s movies and television shows, including 7th Heaven, and then went on to play Isis in the iconic cheerleading movie Bring It On, released in 2000. Union recently starred in the thriller Breaking In, where she portrayed a woman who must find a way to protect her family during a home invasion.","Comedian Larry Miller played Mr. Stratford, an obstetrician who just wants to protect his daughters from teenage boys. At first putting a restriction on their dating life until they graduate, he proposes the idea that Bianca (Oleynik) can date when Kat (Stiles) gets asked on one, knowing that this is unlikely due to Kat’s antisocial personality. Earlier in his career, he took on roles in The Princess Diaries, Max Keeble’s Big Move and My Wife and Kids. More recently, he appeared in the Jennifer Lopez movie Second Act and guest-starred on NCIS.","What's Hot on The Hollywood Reporter","\"It's Been This Weird Crystal Ball\": 'Veep' Stars and Creatives Talk Trump, Chaos and the Series Finale in Dishy Oral History","NAACP Awards: 'Black-ish,' 'Black Panther' Top Winners List","Robert De Niro's Mueller Reads Trump Russia Report in 'SNL' Cold Open","Most Popular","© 2019 The Hollywood Reporter\n\nAll rights reserved.","The Hollywood Reporter, LLC is a subsidiary of Prometheus Global Media, LLC.","Terms of Use |\nPrivacy |\nSitemap |\nAbout Our Ads","Our affiliate publications"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The decision was made after Murdoch’s channel refused to stop showing graphic video footage shot by the man who killed 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday.","This was despite calls from the police urging anyone broadcasting the disturbing footage to stop circulating it. “Police are aware there is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online,” the New Zealand police said in a statement. “We would strongly urge that the link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.”","On Saturday, the New Zealand broadcaster announced the decision to pull the channel off the air. “We stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and have made the decision to remove Sky News Australia from our platform until we are confident that the distressing footage from yesterday’s events will not be shared,” it said in a now-deleted Tweet.","Soon after in a new Tweet, the broadcaster changed its message saying, “We stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and are working with our colleagues at @SkyNewsAust to ensure coverage doesn’t compromise ongoing investigations in NZ. We made the decision on Friday with Sky News Australia to replace their live news with sport.”","In a statement Friday, a Sky News Australia spokesman said: “Sky News in line with other broadcasters ran heavily edited footage that did not show the shootings or the victims.”","Sky News Australia didn’t air in New Zealand for five days, returning on Wednesday, March 20, according to Sky New Zealand. In the interim, the networks worked to change the perception created by Sky New Zealand that Sky News Australia had been forced off the air. Sky New Zealand emailed ThinkProgress on March 21, saying that it “would like to take the opportunity to correct statements made by us on Saturday.”","Sky New Zealand spokesperson Chris Major said in a statement that the networks decided together to pull the coverage shortly after the attacks. “It was a proactive and precautionary decision taken by both parties to ensure any live coverage or commentary taking place in Australia, outside of the NZ jurisdiction, did not compromise the NZ investigations and legal process,” the statement said.","Friday’s mass shooting was streamed to Facebook live video by the shooter for at least 17 minutes. YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter have since been working to remove footage of the massacre, however, new copies of the video continue to be uploaded.","Officials in the U.K. have also called on the tech companies to stop the spread of this footage. “Online platforms have a responsibility not to do the terrorists’ work for them,” British Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote in an article for The Daily Express on Saturday.","The alleged shooter was a self-described terrorist who wrote a manifesto about white supremacy, in which he praised President Donald Trump, calling the president a “symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.” The manifesto also included mention of conservative pundits and other white supremacist killers.","But when asked whether he thought white supremacy was a growing danger around the world, Trump said he did not.","Meanwhile, Murdoch’s Fox News channel in the U.S. has aired several segments in which it positions conservatives as the victims, fearing the Friday massacre is being used as an attempt to limit their free speech.","“Already tonight, you are hearing calls in this country for curbs on free speech in response to the New Zealand massacre,” Fox host Tucker Carlson said Friday night. “Jeff Bezos’ newspaper wasted no time in blaming the entire thing [on] free flow of ideas that are, quote, ‘spreading hate.’ For the censorship class, more control is always the solution. Ban more people, squelch more ideas, go deplatform someone.”","Meanwhile, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh promoted the theory that the whole event may be a false-flag perpetrated by someone on the left in order to blame conservatives.","CORRECTION: This article previously stated that Limbaugh was a radio host for Fox News. This has been updated to state he is a conservative radio host.","UPDATE (3/21/19): This piece has been updated to include a statement by Sky New Zealand correcting its original statement."],"targetCaptions":[]}

It brings this idea to life by urging its audience to \"imagine the world as a street ordered by income.\"","\"People from different continents, with the same income, are neighbors on Dollar Street,\" explains the site's co-creator, Anna Rosling Ronnlund, in a press release.","Created by Ronnlund (the co-author of one of Gates' favorite books \"Factfulness\") and the independent Swedish foundation Gapminder, the website documents over 264 homes in 50 countries, with photographers taking snap shots of daily life and objects, even things that seem trivial, like toothbrushes. Overall, the website says it has over 30,000 photos and 10,000 videos. It uses them to \"show how people on all different income levels meet their universal human needs,\" according to the release.","An interactive graphic at the top of the page features houses lined up on a street. By sliding the ticker at the top of the page to the left, you'll explore the lives of people toward the poorer end of the spectrum, while sliding to the right sends you toward the richer homes.","For example, on the poorest end of the street is a  family in India with a monthly income of $31. Photographs of the household show a makeshift structure created from tarps strung together, with a bed that's simply a tarp on the ground. Meanwhile, on the opposite end is an American family with a monthly income of $4,650. Their bed is large and decorated with a plethora of fluffy pillows.","While it's no surprise that the people living in poverty in India lead very different lives than the affluent crowd in the U.S., the site points out most people live somewhere between \"poor\" and \"rich.\"","And when you compare household objects (another filter along with income and location), it becomes clear there are many similarities among people of the same income level, even when they live in different countries.","\"I found the photos of toothbrushes to be particularly interesting,\" Gates writes in his blog post. \"The families at the poorest end of the street use their fingers or sticks to clean their teeth. But once you reach a certain income level, everyone starts using a plastic toothbrush with bristles.\"","Adds Gates, \"People tend to spend money on the same things once they increase their income whether they live in China or Cameroon.\"","Gates is well-known for his philanthropic efforts and for taking an interest in the way other people live. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation tackles a number of projects aimed at lifting others out of poverty, by providing economic mobility and opportunity, and past blog posts penned by Gates focus on topics like inequality. In his blog post touting Dollar Street, Gates writes that whenever he visits a new location, he looks for clues indicating the income level of locals.","\"If I see power lines, I know homes probably have electricity in this area — which means that kids have enough light to do their homework after the sun sets,\" Gates writes. \"If I see patchwork roofs, families likely sleep less during the rainy season because they're wet and cold. If I see bikes, that tells me people don't have to spend hours walking to get water every day.\"","But for Gates, Dollar Street is a great illustration of what brings people together.","\"At the end of the day, we all want a solid roof over our head, a more efficient way to get around, and better tools to take care of ourselves,\" Gates writes. \"It's a beautiful reminder that we have more in common with people on the other side of the world than we think.\"","Don't miss: Bill Gates is paying off this country's $76 million debt","Like this story?

I live in Los Angeles and recently, I've been seeing a ton of advertisements for something called Vital Proteins collagen. I'm talking billboards, ads, and endcap displays at Target. So, obviously I had to look up what it was!","When I visited their website, I learned that our body slows the production of collagen as we age, so Vital Proteins collagen powder helps promote the production of collagen through their products. The benefits can include hair growth, nail growth, joint health, and digestion. So I decided to try it out for a month and see what I thought.","The first flavor of collagen powder I tried was lavender lemon. I used this when drinking chamomile tea because I honestly wasn't sure what else it would mix well with, but it does taste good with the tea.","The next flavor I tried was matcha. I've always thought matcha was just OK, but there was a matcha latte recipe on the Vital Proteins website that I decided to try to see if my mind would change.","The final result? The recipe did make a beautiful latte, but I JUST wasn't into it. It's not you, matcha collagen latte — it's ME. I am just not a matcha girl. But if you are, then I'm sure you'll find this extremely tasty.","You also don't have to ONLY mix this with liquid. There are plenty of recipes that include some scoops of collagen — like these MATCHA COOKIES recipe.","Get this recipe here.","Then there's the unflavored collagen peptides powder. Because I'm boring, I also mixed this with hot drinks (like coffee). But your cooking options are pretty much endless with this stuff, like this nacho appetizer.","Get the recipe here.","Or if you're wanting something healthier, you can use the unflavored collagen in this turkey burger recipe.","Get this recipe here.","The product I was most excited about was actually the biggest disappointment. The collagen creamer is very thick and very clumpy/sticky. No matter how long I stirred it into my coffee, it would not dissolve fully. There were times I'd been drinking and swallow a tiny clump of collagen powder. YOU BET I GAGGED.","But instead of tossing it, I figured it would be better if you used it for cooking. Because it doesn't necessarily have to dissolve into a liquid — it just needs to be mixed. Like with these lemon cashew balls.","Get the recipe here.","My favorite collagen to use in my morning cup of coffee ended up being the flavorless Marine Collagen. I put two scoops (as directed) into my cup every morning and it blended so smoothly. It even left it a little bit frothy after I stirred. After adding my usual creamer in, it tasted great! No weird flavors or textures.","After about a month, my nails were lookin' GOOOOOD. I was surprised my gel manicure lasted this long — but anyway you can see a huge difference in length. I'm someone who has nails that constantly break/don't grow very long, so this proved SOMETHING was working.","After using Vital Proteins collagen over 60 days, I did see a difference in my hair length as well. It's longer for sure, but my co-worker who took the after picture also noticed how shiny it was.","Overall, I did see a big difference in my nails and a slight difference in my hair. I'm going to continue using the unflavored collagen as well as the lavender lemon (because it was my fave) in the future — and it's so easy to add into a quick cup of coffee or tea.","Find more Vital Proteins recipe here.","Products were provided to BuzzFeed by Vital Proteins.","Top trending videos","Facebook comments","Advertisement","Connect With\n      \n        \n  BuzzFeed\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n      \n      \n        Culture","BuzzFeed HomeSitemap© 2019 BuzzFeed, Inc."],"targetCaptions":[]}

I think we can all agree that by any meaningful definition the guy is pretty smart. It's also obvious he has a talent for surrounding himself with other smart people who can help make his vision reality.","How does he find them? It's a question he addressed when he stopped by the Basecamp offices a few years ago, the company's founder, Jason Fried, reports on the Basecamp blog. And the answer Bezos gave was the exact opposite of what most folks would expect.","Smart people are actually wrong a lot.","Most of us, when we want to figure out if someone is smart, ask if the person is frequently right: Do they have correct knowledge about the world and their area of expertise? Do they come up with the right answers when faced with hard problems? Do their predictions turn out to be right?","But Bezos's counterintuitive strategy isn't just to look at how often people are right. Instead, he also looks for people who can admit they are wrong and change their opinions often.","Bezos has \"observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they'd already solved. They're open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking,\" Fried reports the Amazon boss saying.","\"Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\"","That willingness to consider new information goes hand in hand with a willingness to admit your old way of thinking was flawed. In other words, to be super smart you have to change your mind a lot. Essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson famously said, \"Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\" Bezos apparently agrees that consistency is overrated.","\"He doesn't think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait,\" Fried reports. \"It's perfectly healthy -- encouraged, even -- to have an idea tomorrow that contradicts your idea today.\"","It's not just 19th-century philosophers who agree with Bezos. Modern science does too, although psychologists have a less poetic way of speaking about the flexibility of mind Bezos prizes. They call it intellectual humility. Studies of decision making show that people who are more willing to entertain the idea that they're wrong make markedly better choices. Being wrong, they understand, isn't a sign of stupidity. It's a sign of curiosity, openness to new information, and ultimately smarts.","If famous essays, top CEOs, and the latest research aren't enough to convince you that to be smarter, you need to also be frequently wrong, you can also take it from the undoubtedly smart futurists at Palo Alto's Institute for the Future. According to Stanford professor Bob Sutton, they encapsulate this trait of highly intelligent folks this way: \"strong opinions, which are weakly held.\"","As the futurists explained to Sutton, weakly held (and therefore often changed) opinions are important because they mean you aren't \"too attached to what you believe,\" which  \"undermines your ability to 'see' and 'hear' evidence that clashes with your opinions.\"","So next time you're trying to determine if someone is actually super smart or simply bluffing, don't ask whether they're always right. Instead, ask when was the last time they changed their opinion. If they can't name lots of times they were wrong, they're probably not as smart as they want to appear."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will know that Mjolnir has been the Asgardian's sidekick for his entire time on-screen, hence the heartbreak when it was destroyed by Hela (Cate Blanchett) in Thor: Ragnarok. Luckily for the God of Thunder, he was fortunate enough to get an all-new hammer thanks to Eitri (Peter Dinklage) in Avengers: Infinity War.","In fact, the new hammer -- Stormbreaker -- appears to dwarf the power of its predecessor. But just how powerful is it? Let's take a moment and break it down the situation down. Starting at the birth of the weapon, Stormbreaker was able to save the life of Thor, who just took the full force of a supernova star. Resurrection capabilities aside, Stormbreaker is much more than just a lifesaver.","As seen in one of the most epic entrances of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we saw that Stormbreaker also has the power to summon the Bifrost. Not only can Stormbreaker save a god from his death, but it can also summon the ability to travel anywhere across the Nine Realms at the drop of a hat. Do you think Mjolnir is sweating yet?","Now for the cherry on top...the icing on the proverbial cake. In the hand of Thor, Stormbreaker was able to take on the brunt force of all six Infinity Stones at once. Not one, not two -- but all six the universe's most powerful tools or weapons, depending on how you look at it. Not just that, it likely could have cut off the head of the Mad Titan himself (Josh Brolin), you know -- if Thor would have gone for the head.","Captain Marvel is in theaters now and will be followed up by Avengers: Endgame on April 26th.","Do you think there's another weapon more powerful than Stormbreaker in the MCU?

There’s been speculation that he and Jimmy Butler are interested in teaming up, that he and LeBron James are interested in rejoining forces and that he and Kevin Durant are planning to spurn their teams to sign with the New York Knicks in the summer.","The latest speculation is that Irving would prefer signing with the Nets over the Knicks in the offseason.","Per Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News, “The Brooklyn Nets are also in the running for the enigmatic champion. In fact, some sources around the league believe that Irving prefers the Nets.”","“New York is expected to make a summer run at point guard Kyrie Irving, but the Brooklyn Nets are also in the running for the enigmatic champion. In fact, some sources around the league believe Irving prefers the Nets. In an interview done recently with NBATV, David Griffin — who was the Cavs GM at the same time Irving played for Cleveland — suggested that was the case. Coincidentally, Irving is scheduled to play in Brooklyn with the Celtics on Saturday.”","“I think Brooklyn is the fit that’s better for him in terms of his mindset,” Griffin said. “I think he likes what they’ve done there, culturally.”","The idea that Irving would prefer to sign with the Nets over the Knicks makes sense from a purely basketball standpoint, with Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson earning respect around the league and the Nets themselves having shown steady improvement and looking like a team worthy of playoff-contention – even without players of Irving or Durant’s caliber.","In fact, Brooklyn is currently ranked seventh in the Eastern Conference standings. At 38-38, they’ve already won 10 more games than they won all of last season and 18 more games than they won in 2016-17. They play hard, unselfishly and maximize the talent on their roster.","Ultimately, with the Nets set to have up to $54.6 million in cap space without making any trades (per Spotrac), they’ll have enough to sign a max free agent or two players on near-max contracts. Nonetheless, whether Irving wants to play by himself or with a player like Jimmy Butler or Durant, they present themselves as a better option than the Knicks on the court.","Though led by a respected head coach in David Fizdale and in line to draft a top prospect this offseason, New York isn’t as far along in their development as the Nets. They have fewer veteran players and established locker room leaders as well.","Players want to be on a team that they believe is headed in the right direction and though the Knicks have the potential to be that type of ball club at some point in the future, the Nets are already there.","Regardless, the Celtics still present a better option for Irving than either the Knicks or the Nets from a basketball standpoint. They’re led by a renowned head coach in Brad Stevens, have already achieved a fair amount of regular season and postseason success and they have far more talent than either New York or Brooklyn.","The only reason Irving would prefer to sign with the Knicks or Nets is if he was attracted to the New York market and wanted a homecoming of sorts.","2019 nba free agency, boston celtics, kyrie irving, nba free agency, Analysis, News","More Celtics Wire","Latest","News","Kyrie Irving's connection to Jason Kidd could fuel move to Brooklyn","News","Paul Pierce's advice for Jayson Tatum to reach an All-Star level","News","Marcus Morris: 'In 10 years they can do a 30 for 30 on this team'","Analysis","Gordon Hayward continues to feel more comfortable attacking the rim","Injuries","Jayson Tatum upgraded to available vs. Nets","Injuries","Kyrie Irving, Al Horford ruled out for matchup vs. Nets","News","Potential top-5 pick Jarrett Culver uses Jayson Tatum as a muse","Analysis","Kyrie Irving: 'I rely on [Aron Baynes] a lot'","News","Kyrie Irving speaks on fan's remarks towards DeMarcus Cousins","Analysis","Al Horford and Aron Baynes' 'great chemistry' on display vs. Pacers","This site is neither endorsed, nor sponsored by, nor affiliated with Boston Celtics or NBA Properties LLC.

The godown allegedly belongs to a local DMK functionary Poonjolai Srinivasan. According to sources in the I-T department, the search is still in progress in Vellore and the seized amount exceeds Rs 10 crore. Pictures of the seized cash show that bundles of new currency notes of various denominations were stuffed inside gunny sacks, big shopping bags and cardboard boxes. I-T officials believe that the cash may have been intended for distribution to voters.","The Chief Electoral Officer of TN Satyabrata Sahoo, meanwhile, said that the search was conducted based on the information received by the District Electoral Officer of Vellore. Stating that a report will be given to the Election Commission if the seized money is related to the polls, CEO Satyabrata Sahoo said that appropriate action will be taken by the Election Commission based on the report submitted by the Income Tax department.","The seizure comes just days I-T officials started raiding senior DMK leader Durai Murugan’s properties. Both I-T and EC officials arrived at 10 pm on Friday, March 29, at Durai Murugan’s house and college, when a scuffle broke out over who had jurisdiction to conduct the raids. Finally, I-T raids began around 3 am on Saturday, March 30.","Many reports stated that the cash was shifted from a college that was part of Duraimurugan Educational Trust, to the godown. Satyabrata Sahoo told the media, \"We need to see if this money is connected to any party or candidate. We have no details of the seizure from the Income-tax department.\"","According to sources, I-T officials will be looking into whether the cash was stored by any of the parties or candidates contesting from Vellore. While the DMK is fielding senior leader Durai Murugan’s son Kathir Anand, the AIADMK+ candidate is Puthiya Needhi Katchi founder AC Shanmugam. The businessman is the chancellor of the Dr MGR Educational and Research Institute. TTV Dhinakaran’s AMMK has nominated Pandurangan to contest from the seat while R Suresh will represent Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam in the constituency.","Meanwhile, Kathir Anand’s lawyer pleaded in Madras High Court on Monday that the Income Tax department’s raids are obstructing Kathir Anand from campaigning in his constituency for the upcoming polls. Stating that Kathir Anand has been detained illegally by the Income Tax officials and that it was against democratic principles, the advocate requested the court to intervene in the matter. The judges said that the court would hear it on Tuesday if the parties file a petition regarding the issue."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Pressing a button and inhaling (or sometimes simply inhaling) heats the liquid, creating an aerosol that can be inhaled the same way tobacco smoke from a regular cigarette is inhaled.","Juuls were introduced to American consumers in 2015, well after other brands of electronic cigarettes. But Juuls quickly became very popular, due to their small size; the cartridges are not much bigger than a typical USB flash drive. Their compact size makes concealing the devices easier, and this—along with bubblegum-like flavors—may help explain why Juuls and vaping (another name for smoking e-cigarettes) have become so popular with kids.","You may have seen marketing claims that Juuls are safer than cigarettes, but health experts aren’t so sure. Indeed, research suggests that e-cigarettes can be potentially toxic and dangerous for your lungs.","The liquid contains toxic substances","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","Cigarettes are much maligned because of the thousands of chemicals in each puff. E-cigarettes may not have as high a number of ingredients, but they do contain chemicals that are not considered safe and nontoxic. “Vaping contains nicotine but also propylene glycol, flavored chemicals, glycerin, and byproducts including formaldehyde, which is toxic to the lungs,” says Janette Nesheiwat, MD, family and emergency physician.","Each puff from a Juul pod releases a nicotine dose similar to a traditional cigarette—and at least 70 chemicals—but the concentration arrives at the nicotine receptors in your body up to 2.7 times faster than with other electronic cigarettes. Indeed, smoking a Juul could be as dangerous as smoking a pack a day for teenagers.","The risks grow the longer you vape","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","A study in the journal Oral Oncology linked e-cigarettes to cancer-related cell damage. With each puff, you’re inhaling two primary e-cigarette ingredients—propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin—which contain a high level of toxins. What’s more, toxicity from these ingredients increases the more you vape. And that’s not the only risk—check out 8 silent ways e-cigarettes harm your body.","Heating releases potentially toxic chemicals","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","“Although e-cigarettes are noncombustible, the heating process does release chemicals such as formaldehyde, which are known carcinogens,” says Amy M. Ahasic, MD, MPH, section chief, pulmonary and critical care medicine at Norwalk Hospital, WCHN.","“While the individual components of e-liquids—propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavoring, nicotine—are safe and approved for consumption, when they are heated, as they are with the Juul device, they create carbonyls—acrolein and formaldehyde—as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH),” Dr. Nesheiwat says. “All of these can cause irritation and even irreversible lung damage. Acrolein, when inhaled, has been linked to lung cancer. PAHs are carcinogenic as well.”","Juuls irritate and inflame the lungs","MaryCaroline/Shutterstock","“[Some Juul] ingredients are known to cause irritation and inflammation in the lungs; prolonged exposure can result in damage to the DNA of the cells, which then results in cancer after prolonged exposure,” Dr. Nesheiwat says. “It can also cause what’s called ‘wet lung,’” Wet lung is basically irritation in the lung that inflames the tissue and mimics pneumonia. “It can be life-threatening as well and results in sudden life-threatening respiratory distress.”","Flavorings contain known toxic substances","MaryCaroline/Shutterstock","Juul pods come in eight flavors, with options like mango, mint, and cucumber. Many e-cigarette flavors often contain diacetyl, a chemical that has been shown to irritate and damage airways. The chemical is often used to create “buttery” flavors—it’s the ingredient in microwave popcorn that makes it one of the 12 foods you think are healthy but are not and is a reason microwave popcorn is a food that cancer docs won’t eat. Research has shown that workers at factories producing the chemical have developed a specific type of lung disease—referred to as “popcorn worker’s lung.” Indeed, diacetyl vapors are considered a workplace hazard.","“The flavors themselves are chemicals that are known to cause chronic lung disease,” says Dr. Ahasic, who is also the chair of the occupational and environmental health network of the American College of Chest Physicians. “While we haven’t really seen that with e-cigarettes yet, it’s the same chemical. The type of lung disease that we see with flavorings-related lung disease is quite serious. In some cases, it can be lethal.”","Juuls may not help you stop smoking","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","E-cigarettes in general, and Juuls in particular, are marketed as a safer alternative to cigarettes and a tool to help people give up tobacco products. However, research has not found them to be a safer alternative, or particularly helpful in getting people to quit.","“When people are trying to break the habit and then they are using something that looks and feels similar to a cigarette and are inhaling similar to a cigarette, they are really enforcing the smoking behavior,” Dr. Ahasic says. “That can make it not a very good smoking cessation tool.”","Heat can damage airways","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","“The heat itself can be an irritant,” Dr. Ahasic says. “It can cause inflammation of the airways… That can cause cough and mucus and shortness of breath in some people. There can be pretty immediate effects on the airways from the irritant factors of all the fine particulate matter you’re inhaling—and that’s true of e-cigarettes, aerosols, as well as traditional cigarettes.”","Irritation overtime can lead to inflammation, which may be a risk factor for lung diseases, including lung cancer. Thinking e-cigarettes are a such a healthy alternative to cigarettes is one of the 50 health mistakes people make every day.","Juuls may cause secondhand smoke damage","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","We’re all aware of some of the dangers of secondhand smoke; unfortunately, no one considers the dangers of secondhand e-smoke. “There is less in an e-cigarettes aerosol that’s bad, but it’s still there,” Dr. Ahasic says. “When it’s in a lower concentration, how much longer might it take for us to see the effects because the intensity of the exposure may be less?”","We simply don’t know enough yet","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","“The problem is we really don’t have any long-term health data, Dr. Ahasic says. “E-cigarettes have been on the market for less than 15 years,” she points out. “If we think about lung cancer, the majority of patients diagnosed with lung cancer are aged 65 or greater, and many of those people started smoking when they were in their teens and 20s.”","In 2016, the U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek H. Murthy, MD, MBA, released a report on the use of e-cigarettes among youth and young adults, warning: “Although e-cigarettes generally emit fewer toxicants than combustible tobacco products, we know that aerosol from e-cigarettes is not harmless.” If you’ve heard enough and are ready to quit, here are the 23 best ways to stop smoking.","Reader Interactions","Sign Up for Our Newsletters"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The company is unveiling streaming video and news subscriptions, key parts of Apple's push to transform itself into a leading digital services provider. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg","I watched the Apple special event today on my iPad. Much of the fanfare will fall on Apple Arcade, Apple TV+ and Apple News+. And then there was the surprise guest, Oprah Winfrey. For me, as an Apple shareholder, the big news was the new Apple credit card.","Apple partnered with Goldman Sachs and MasterCard to introduce the Apple Card. Available this summer, it will be a game changer.","Here's why.","Rewards","The cash back rewards of the Apple Card are best in class. Consumers will earn 3% cash back on purchases at Apple, 2% cash back on all other purchases using Apple Pay, and 1% cash back on purchases with the physical, titanium credit card. These rewards alone qualify the card as one of the best cash back credit cards available today. It competes head-to-head with the likes of the Citi Double Cash and Fidelity Visa cards.","Three features of this rewards system stand out. The first is that the 2% cash back requires the use of Apple Pay. While Apple Pay has penetrated the U.S. retailing market, there are plenty of stores that still don't accept it. I know because it's annoying to waive my iPhone over the credit card device only to realize that I'm at a retailer that has yet to join the 21st century. If the demand for Apple Card is high, it could encourage more retailers to accept Apple Pay. And the 2% rewards will encourage more consumers to use it.","Second, the Apple Card pays out the cash back rewards daily. No longer do you need to wait to accrue a minimum amount of rewards or redeem them online. Cash back is added to your account daily. Called Daily Cash, it will be added to customers' Apple Cash card each day. It can be used for purchases using Apple Pay, to pay down the Apple Card balance, or even to send to friends via iMessage.","Finally, the 3% rewards apply not only to purchases at Apple stores, but also on the App Store and for Apple services. This should in turn drive more consumers to the Apple ecosystem.","Fees","In short, there are none. At least there are no fees that really matter. There is no annual fee, late fee, international fee, or over-the-limit fee. There's not even a penalty rate.","The App","As one would expect from Apple, the Apple Card app's simplicity is stunning. It clearly shows the card's balance, how many days until a payment is due, and daily and weekly spending activity by category. In this way, the app could function as a stand alone budgeting tool. With just a tap you can see your spending by color-coded category as well as your weekly and monthly total spending.","What caught my eye, however, is how it conveys payment and interest rate information to the consumer. The app will enable consumers to easily change their monthly payment amount to see how it will affect interest charges. As you slide the total payment higher, the app indicates how long it will take to pay off the balance given that payment amount. Consumers can then pay their monthly bill right from the app.","And speaking of payments, the Apple Card has finally done what I know many consumers want. Apple has made it easy to make multiple monthly payments in order to reduce interest charges.","The app will make it easier to understand the source of a purchase. Have you ever seen a credit card line item from a store you didn't recognize? As I record my spending in YNAB every week, I encounter this on a regular basis. With the iPhone location service, you can identify where a purchase occurred and the name of the store.","Finally, support is just a text message away.","It will be interesting to see how other credit card issuers respond. One thing is for sure. The combination of an excellent cash back card with the simplicity and functionality of the Apple Card app has the potential to change the industry in a way that's better for consumers.","Rob Berger is the Deputy Editor of Forbes Money Advisor and founder of Doughroller.net and allcards.com.

Traffic is my profession. I resolved that problem for Turkey, I can very well resolve it for Istanbul.\"","Meanwhile, after losing the last two battles in Istanbul with high-profile candidates, the main opposition CHP party is trying its chance with a humble district mayor.","Having spent his last five years as a mayor in Istanbul's banlieu district of Beylikduzu, 49-year-old Ekrem Imamoglu says: \"You will see it in five years, we will provide an immense reduction in Istanbul's traffic.\"","'I prefer losing money'","Despite the claims, 29-year-old Yusuf who works as an editor at a publishing house cannot see more tranquil roads in his near future.","\"I spend three hours in traffic everyday,\" he told Middle East Eye.","\"My office is 20km away from my neighbourhood and congestion takes away my energy and prevents me from focusing on my work.","\"Four months ago I received a job offer.

I find them exciting as everybody agrees that Istanbul needs more metro and rail lines.","\"However, the solutions they offer are not real solutions, because the roots of the problem are more profound.\"","As a long-term traffic sufferer he speaks like an expert and says that Istanbul needs more, much more, metro lines.","'Traffic makes us edgy'","Describing her daily routine, Buse Cetinkaya, a 30-year-old business consultant at a major car company says: \"I spend one hour to go to work every morning. Then again, coming back home takes two and a half hours.","\"That means three or four hours of wasted and inefficient time every week day. That much time affects not only my psychology but my body too. I feel more tired then I actually am.\"","Cetinkaya seems bored even talking about it and says: \"In traffic we lose our patience towards each other. We lose our tolerance and respect. Because of my work, I travel to Stuttgart, Germany once in every two weeks.\"","According to INRIX, Stuggart is way down the list of congested cities of the world at 102nd.","\"I notice that people are more happy and peaceful there. I can count many reasons but I think one of the most important reasons is traffic congestion,\" says Cetinkaya.","While Stuttgart has traffic jams only in rush hours, Istanbul has it every moment of the day. Hours of traffic exposure exhausts bodies and souls.","\"It makes us edgy. Because we cannot spare time for ourselves,\" she adds.","'The one who takes Istanbul will take Turkey'","- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan","In terms of a solution, Cetinkaya is a fundamentalist. She does not believe that candidates can cure the traffic disease unless both the government and the people make a radical shift in their point of view.","\"Government sets up huge projects like a third bridge on the Bosphorus or a tunnel under the sea. But the real problem is in the details,\" she says.","\"They need to focus on the relatively small obstacles such as overwhelmed crossroads or wrongly designed routes.\"","Quality of life","Mehmet, a 52-year-old high-ranking financial executive, says: \"My office moved from the European side to the Anatolian side.","\"That reduced my daily traffic time, from 4.5 hours to 1.5 hours. Now I eat my dinner and complete a short stroll by the time that I previously would have just been arriving home.","\"As a person who works in a busy atmosphere and stressful environment, being able to spare time for myself has added great value to my quality of life,\" he adds, mentioning uneducated, impatient and distressed drivers as one of the many reasons behind traffic stress.","Cezayir Dogan, the editor-in-chief of Radio Traffic, Istanbul's only traffic radio, says: \"There is no doubt that the number one problem of Istanbul is traffic congestion.","\"And people are closely following the projects on this subject.

He cheats when people are watching and he cheats when they aren’t. He cheats whether you like it or not. He cheats because that’s how he plays golf … if you’re playing golf with him, he’s going to cheat.”","Reilly, a former Sports Illustrated columnist who has played with Trump in the past, spoke to dozens of players — both amateur and professional — to recount some of the president’s worst cons on the course, starting with his declared handicap of 2.8.","In layman’s terms, the lower the handicap, the better the player. Jack Nicklaus, winner of a record 18 major golf titles and generally considered the greatest golfer in the history of the game, has a handicap of 3.4.","Nicklaus’ handicap is listed on the same Golf Handicap and Information Network website used by Trump, where players post their scores.","“If Trump is a 2.8,” writes Reilly, “Queen Elizabeth is a pole vaulter.”","Shortly after he became president, Trump played with Tiger Woods, the current world No. 1 Dustin Johnson and the veteran PGA Tour pro Brad Faxon. Given the quality and profile of his companions, you might have thought Trump would have been on his best behavior. Not so.","On one hole, Trump dunked a shot into the lake, but as his opponents weren’t looking he simply dropped another ball — and then hit that into the water, too.","“So he drives up and drops where he should’ve dropped the first time and hits it on the green,” recalls Faxon.","The actor Samuel L. Jackson has also witnessed the underhanded methods Trump employs, according to Reilly.","“We clearly saw him hook a ball into a lake at Trump National [Bedminster, New Jersey],” he says, “and his caddy told him he found it!”","The boxer Oscar De La Hoya and rocker Alice Cooper have also seen the same shenanigans first hand, while LPGA player Suzann Pettersen, another victim, thinks it’s all down to his caddy “since no matter how far into the woods he hits the ball, it’s in the middle of the fairway when we get there.”","And Trump doesn’t just tamper with his own balls.","During a game with Mike Tirico before Trump was elected, the former ESPN football announcer hit the shot of his life, a 230-yard 3-wood towards an elevated green he couldn’t see. But he knew it was close.","When he got to the putting green, however, Tirico’s ball was nowhere to be seen. Instead, it was 50 feet left of the hole in a bunker.","It made no sense — until Trump’s caddy caught up with him after the round.","“Trump’s caddy came up to me and said, ‘You know that shot you hit on the par 5?’” Tirico says. “‘It was about 10 feet from the hole. Trump threw it in the bunker. I watched him do it.’”","Even Trump’s golf courses lie. As the owner of 14 golf clubs and with his name on another five, Trump has, according to Reilly, been known to wildly exaggerate their standing in course rankings, overvalue them and even play fast and loose with their locations.","At Trump Washington at Lowes Island, there’s a Civil War monument (bearing Trump’s name, obviously) between the 14th and 15th holes, reminding golfers of how many soldiers, from North and South, died at that very spot.","It’s a nice touch, even though several Civil War historians have confirmed that no battle took place anywhere near the memorial.","And what about his course at Bedminster? There’s a plaque there with a quote from the renowned course architect Tom Fazio.","It reads:","This is the best design I’ve ever done.","TOM FAZIO","Except that’s not true, either.","“I don’t believe I said it exactly like that,” Fazio told Reilly.","In a game where etiquette is everything, Reilly reports that Trump never takes his cap off for the end-of-round handshake, nor does he remove it in the clubhouse afterward, presumably for fear of what damage a sweaty round might have done to that hairstyle.","He’s even been known to drive his golf cart onto the putting green, an offense Reilly likens to “hanging your laundry in the Sistine Chapel.”","Quite why Trump cheats is another matter. He is, by all accounts, a very good golfer for his age (even Tiger Woods was impressed) but seems incapable of playing by the rules. Does he even care?","To that, Reilly offers a simple reply.","“Golf,” he writes, “is like bicycle shorts. It reveals a lot about a man.”","Share this:","Share this article:","Share this:","Read Next","Texas state trooper recovering after he was shot by civili...","Read Next","Texas state trooper recovering after he was shot by civili...","Share Selection","Trending Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton NYPost.com","This story has been shared 36,540 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t36,540","This story has been shared 34,882 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t34,882","This story has been shared 26,038 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26,038","Now On\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow on Page Six","SEE ALL","Video","Warrant issued for suspect who hit man after asking if he was gay","Now On\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow on Decider","SEE ALL","More Stories","page six","The internet cannot handle Jennifer Lopez's sexy bikini photo","nypost","The Yankees have a new Gary Sanchez problem","Post Digital Network","© 2019 NYP Holdings, Inc.

All-powerful. All-knowing. The idea of the deity most Westerners accept is actually not coherent.","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["Opinion","Perfect. All-powerful. All-knowing. The idea of the deity most Westerners accept is actually not coherent.","CreditCreditReuters","Supported by","By Peter Atterton","Mr. Atterton is a professor of philosophy.","If you look up “God” in a dictionary, the first entry you will find will be something along the lines of “a being believed to be the infinitely perfect, wise and powerful creator and ruler of the universe.” Certainly, if applied to non-Western contexts, the definition would be puzzling, but in a Western context this is how philosophers have traditionally understood “God.” In fact, this conception of God is sometimes known as the “God of the Philosophers.”","As a philosopher myself, I’d like to focus on a specific question: Does the idea of a morally perfect, all-powerful, all-knowing God make sense? Does it hold together when we examine it logically?","Let’s first consider the attribute of omnipotence.","You’ve probably heard the paradox of the stone before: Can God create a stone that cannot be lifted? If God can create such a stone, then He is not all powerful, since He Himself cannot lift it. On the other hand, if He cannot create a stone that cannot be lifted, then He is not all powerful, since He cannot create the unliftable stone. Either way, God is not all powerful.","The way out of this dilemma is usually to argue, as Saint Thomas Aquinas did, that God cannot do self-contradictory things. Thus, God cannot lift what is by definition “unliftable,” just as He cannot “create a square circle” or get divorced (since He is not married). God can only do that which is logically possible.","Not all philosophers agree with Aquinas. René Descartes, for example, believed that God could do absolutely anything, even the logically impossible, such as draw a round square. But even if we accept, for the sake of argument, Aquinas’ explanation, there are other problems to contend with. For example, can God create a world in which evil does not exist? This does appear to be logically possible. Presumably God could have created such a world without contradiction. It evidently would be a world very different from the one we currently inhabit, but a possible world all the same. Indeed, if God is morally perfect, it is difficult to see why he wouldn’t have created such a world. So why didn’t He?","The standard defense is that evil is necessary for free will. According to the well-known Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga, “To create creatures capable of moral good, [God] must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can’t give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so.” However, this does not explain so-called physical evil (suffering) caused by nonhuman causes (famines, earthquakes, etc.). Nor does it explain, as Charles Darwin noticed, why there should be so much pain and suffering among the animal kingdom: “A being so powerful and so full of knowledge as a God who could create the universe, is to our finite minds omnipotent and omniscient, and it revolts our understanding to suppose that his benevolence is not unbounded, for what advantage can there be in the sufferings of millions of the lower animals throughout almost endless time?”","What about God’s infinite knowledge — His omniscience? Philosophically, this presents us with no less of a conundrum. Leaving aside the highly implausible idea that God knows all the facts in the universe, no matter how trivial or useless (Saint Jerome thought it was beneath the dignity of God to concern Himself with such base questions as how many fleas are born or die every moment), if God knows all there is to know, then He knows at least as much as we know. But if He knows what we know, then this would appear to detract from His perfection. Why?","There are some things that we know that, if they were also known to God, would automatically make Him a sinner, which of course is in contradiction with the concept of God. As the late American philosopher Michael Martin has already pointed out, if God knows all that is knowable, then God must know things that we do, like lust and envy. But one cannot know lust and envy unless one has experienced them. But to have had feelings of lust and envy is to have sinned, in which case God cannot be morally perfect.","What about malice? Could God know what malice is like and still retain His divine goodness? The 19-century German pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer was perhaps the first philosopher to draw attention to what he called the “diabolical” in his work “On Human Nature”:","For man is the only animal which causes pain to others without any further purpose than just to cause it. Other animals never do it except to satisfy their hunger, or in the rage of combat …. No animal ever torments another for the mere purpose of tormenting, but man does it, and it is this that constitutes the diabolical feature in his character which is so much worse than the merely animal.","It might be argued, of course, that this is precisely what distinguishes humans from God. Human beings are inherently sinful whereas God is morally perfect. But if God knows everything, then God must know at least as much as human beings do. And if human beings know what it is like to want to inflict pain on others for pleasure’s sake, without any other benefit, then so does God. But to say that God knows what it is like to want to inflict pain on others is to say that God is capable of malicious enjoyment.","However, this cannot be true if it really is the case that God is morally perfect. A morally perfect being would never get enjoyment from causing pain to others. Therefore, God doesn’t know what it is like to be human. In that case He doesn’t know what we know. But if God doesn’t know what we know, God is not all knowing, and the concept of God is contradictory. God cannot be both omniscient and morally perfect. Hence, God could not exist.","(I shall here ignore the argument that God knows what it is like to be human through Christ, because the doctrine of the Incarnation presents us with its own formidable difficulties: Was Christ really and fully human? Did he have sinful desires that he was required to overcome when tempted by the devil? Can God die?)","It is logical inconsistencies like these that led the 17th-century French theologian Blaise Pascal to reject reason as a basis for faith and return to the Bible and revelation. It is said that when Pascal died his servant found sewn into his jacket the words: “God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob — not of the philosophers and scholars.” Evidently, Pascal considered there was more “wisdom” in biblical revelation than in any philosophical demonstration of God’s existence and nature — or plain lack thereof.","Peter Atterton is a professor of philosophy at San Diego State University.","Now in print: “Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments,” and “The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments,” with essays from the series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.","The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

While America’s attention has been focused primarily","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["You can subscribe to the KrassenCast podcast on iTunes, Youtube. and Google Play.","While America’s attention has been focused primarily on the Mueller report, over the course of the last several weeks, a story that likely isn’t clearly captured in the Mueller report has been building steam. For well over a year now, there has been speculation about Jared Kushner’s security clearance, as well as his meetings and ties with various leaders within the Middle East. Now it appears as if this speculation is becoming a full-blown scandal.","Last week on KrassenCast we spoke to Vicky Ward, an investigative journalist and author of the new book Kushner Inc. Since then, Ward, who has been investigating ties that Kushner has had with the Saudis, Emiratis and Qataris, has come across new information that appears to imply that the president’s son-in-law may be extorting the nation of Qatar.  HillReporter has also been in contact with several sources with ties to the Qatari government, which also help confirm some of the information that Ward has provided.  Ward made another appearance today on KrassenCast, in Episode 12, that is now available on iTunes, Youtube. and Google Play","It all started back in April of 2017, after Jared Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, met with the Qatari finance minister at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City.","“Charles Kushner asked for $1 billion according to someone in that meeting, to whom I have spoken. The Qataris turned Charles Kushner down because the deal was a bad deal,” Ward explained to KrassenCast.","The deal she is talking about was in regards to a building owned by Kushner Properties located at 666 5th Ave. At the time, the company was headed towards a foreclosure of the property as a balloon payment came due in January of 2019. According to some sources, the revenue from the building only covered approximately 50% of the mortgage payment.","Ward then went on to explain the shocking details of what happened next, according to Qatari officials:","“What I have learned is that in the ensuing month [May 2017] before the US visit to Riyadh, Jared Kushner got on a plane and flew to Doha, the Qatari capital, and he reamed the Qatari ruling family, the al-Thanis, for not doing the deal with his father… They began to feel that he was indirectly threatening their sovereignty. The next thing they know, when they show up to the summit in Riyadh, the Emir, the ruler of Qatar, arrives with an entourage, but his entourage is suddenly cut off from him, and not allowed into the summit at the same time by the Saudis, which he felt was a move to deliberately make him look weak. You have to remember during this summit, Jared and Ivanka go off for a cozy secret unmonitored dinner with [Saudi Crown Prince] MBS. Nobody knows what they talked about,” Ward explained to KrassenCast.","Just ten days later, against the advice of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis, the United States supported the Saudi and UAE-led blockade of Qatar. On June 6, 2017 President Trump shockingly supported the blockade of a key US ally in the region, forcing many within his own Administration and the GOP to question the move publicly.","“What the Qataris found was not just a blockade. There were Saudi [and] Emerati troops on their border,” Ward explained to KrassenCast. “What they interpreted this as, was Jared Kushner basically saying, ‘if you don’t pay my father and pay off this building, look what’s going to happen. We’re going to, I’m going to, the Americans are going to sanction an invasion of your country.’ Sources in the State Department say, yes, it’s true; troops were on the border,” Ward continued.","Nine months later, a Canadian company, Brookfield Partners, who the Qatari Investment Authority owns a $1.8 billion or 9% stake in, bailed out Kushner Properties, with a 99-year lease agreement for 666 5th Ave.","“They bail it out in a deal that makes absolutely no economic sense. They do a 99-year lease and they pay the entire 99-year lease up front. You don’t need to be good at math, you don’t need to be in the New York real estate community to understand how crazy that is,” Ward told KrassenCast.","Around this same time, President Trump publicly shifts course, no longer supporting the blockade, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Saudi Arabia to stop the embargo.","Last week, after hearing from two sources claiming to be familiar with the deal, HillReporter reached out to Brookfield for comment.  Andrew Brent, the head of communications for Brookfield Properties denied that Qatar or QIA had any involvement in 666 5th Ave. deal.","“Please use this from me as a spokesperson for Brookfield as our on-the-record response to your inquiry: ‘Neither QIA nor any Qatari officials had any involvement at any point with Brookfield’s transaction for 666 Fifth Avenue,'” Brent told HillReporter","When we specifically asked Brent if the Qatari government knew that the deal would be taking place prior to its announcement, which would have been counter to other public statements made by Brookfield, Brent cut off all communications with us.  In fact, we called and emailed him, as well as the company’s Senior Managing Partner and the Chairman, Ric Clark, several times, without getting a response.","We asked Ward her opinion on whether Qatar wanted it to be known that Kushner was likely extorting their nation by using the Saudi government as his pawn. Her response was rather frightening.","“I think the Qataris probably want it out there, but they don’t want their fingerprints on it because that would be dangerous to them. I think they’re genuinely afraid of Jared Kushner, so they don’t want to be associated with getting the story out there. They think their sovereignty is under threat and Jared is behind it. So, and they want that to end,” Ward explained.","Ward closed out the interview with the shocking revelation that she has heard that there is documentation out there to prove this apparent extortion attempt by Mr. Kushner and the Trump White House. Ward is continuing to investigate the matter.  HillReporter has also separately been made aware of possible documentation that exists by additional sources.","The entire, shocking interview with Vicky Ward is now available on iTunes, Youtube. and Google Play, as well as in the embedded video below.","Vicky Ward’s new book is now available on Amazon.","You can subscribe to the KrassenCast podcast on iTunes, Youtube. and Google Play."],"targetCaptions":[]}

I have nothing to do with this man, other than that I passively received a donation from him.\"","Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has said the group will be dissolved if it is deemed to be a terrorist organisation.","\"There must be no tolerance for dangerous ideologies in our country - no matter if it's radical Islam or right-wing fanaticism,\" he said.","The main suspect in the Christchurch mosque attacks, Australian Brenton Tarrant, also seems to have had a preoccupation with Austrian history - something the interior minister said was being investigated.","Austrian landmark","The suspect's clothes and weapons were covered with writing and symbols.","One of the words daubed in white on a gun magazine was \"Vienna\".","There was also a string of names of historical figures, including that of Count Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg, the military commander of Vienna during the Ottoman siege of 1683.","Starhemberg and his company of 20,000 men defended the city against the 120,000-strong Ottoman army, which was eventually defeated by the combined forces of Poles, Habsburgs and the Holy Roman Empire.","The Battle of Vienna in 1683 is often cited by historians as the point where the Ottoman advance on Western Europe was stopped; the turning of the tide in the Muslim/Christian struggle for the control of Europe.","As such, it is a date celebrated by the far right, including, it seems, the Christchurch suspect, who is a self-confessed anti-Muslim white supremacist.","'The Great Replacement'","The Documentation Archive of the Austrian Resistance (DOEW), which researches extreme-right activity, says there are \"many rhetorical and ideological overlaps\" between groups like the Identitarians and the suspected Christchurch attacker.","\"The title of the attacker's manifesto, The Great Replacement (which sees immigrants as a threat to \"white\" Western culture) was a slogan popularised by the Identitarians,\" DOEW said on its website.","\"Regardless of the outcome of the investigation,\" DOEW says, the Identitarians seem to be sticking to their narrative \"for the time being\". It points to an IBÖ statement from last week, which speaks of the \"Great Replacement\" and calls for \"De-Islamification\".","The whole affair is uncomfortable not just for the Identitarians, but for Austria's government as well.","Mr Kurz's own conservative Austrian People's Party is in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), making Austria the only country in Western Europe with a far-right presence in government.","FPÖ leader and Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache said on Wednesday that his party had \"nothing to do with the Identitarians\".","However, Austrian media published photos of FPÖ politicians with members of the group, and Bernhard Weidinger from DOEW told the BBC that there were many links between FPÖ politicians and members of the IBÖ, who often attended each other's events.","In 2016, before he became interior minister, Herbert Kickl gave a speech to a far-right conference in Linz, called Defenders of Europe. The FPÖ politician addressed his audience, which included Identitarians, as \"like-minded people\", according to Austrian media reports.","The FPÖ has also long celebrated the Battle of Vienna victory of 1683. In 2010 it even published a comic, set during the siege, featuring Mr Strache as a knight saving Vienna's cathedral from an Ottoman minaret.","And when Mr Strache and Mr Kurz presented their government programme back in 2017, shortly before the coalition was sworn in, they broke with tradition, and held the event on Vienna's Kahlenberg mountain, where the Battle of Vienna took place.","Asked if there was any historical significance to the choice of venue, Mr Kurz said no.","But in a video blog, Mr Sellner hailed it as \"a good omen\".","Related Topics","Share this story        About sharing","More on this story","Top Stories","Julian Smith suggests closer links with the EU were \"inevitable\" after Conservatives lost majority in 2017.","Features","10 stories that look like April Fools but aren't","'My mission to make news less sad'","Reading the No Outsiders books","New Radio 1 show: 'Random, filthy, ridiculous'","Is our love of true crime problematic?","The butcher who went vegan in secret","Which countries will hold the power in 20 years' time?","The spirit of Somerset captured in black and white","'A lot of the team started to get ill'","Elsewhere on the BBC","Pet Sounds","Music your pets will love","Daily news briefing direct to your inbox","Sign up for our newsletter","BBC News Navigation","BBC News Services","Explore the BBC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Wednesday it was revealed that Angelina Jolie is in talks to join Chloe Zhao's The Eternals.\n\nWhile details on the film have been locked up tighter than Odin's vault, The Eternals, based on the epic saga by comic book legend Jack Kirby, focuses on immortal superpowered beings created by the Celestials, the cosmic giants seen in the Infinity Stones sequence in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Zhao's film is said to be led by Sersi and Ikaris, two Eternals whose love story rests at the center of an eons-spanning conflict.\n\nMarvel had no comment on who Jolie might play, but given that she's the first actor to be cast, it seems likely that she's up for the transmutation-powered Sersi. Jolie also looks a great deal like many artists' depiction of the character. But who is Sersi? And what does Jolie's casting tell us about the film?","Unlike the previous films that have made up the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Eternals is based around largely unknown entities, even for most comic book readers. This unknown quality plus the fact that Marvel Comics hasn't made much effort in reprinting Kirby's series or key appearances of the characters (yet), adds a level of excitement and novelty to Zhao's feature. As a property that's more situated in the realm of sci-fi and fantasy than superhero yarns, learning about the Eternals is akin to taking a deep-dive into J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth history or George R.R. Martin's Westeros and Essos. While the Guardians of the Galaxy were mostly unknown to most audiences before 2014, the Eternals are even more of a deep-dive into the Marvel Universe. When it comes to the Celestials, the Eternals and their evil counterparts the Deviants (Thanos' race), this is heavy Marvel mythology, the building blocks of the universe, and far more complex than anything we've seen Marvel Studios adapt thus far.","Casting Jolie in a film such as this is a way for Marvel to ground the audience in a complicated mythology with a familiar face. But it's also a signal that if an actress on this level of influence, one who has largely focused on directing and producing of late, is interested, then it must be something special.\n\nMarvel Studios, with a few exceptions, has long played the game of star-making when it comes to leading roles, taking talented actors and actresses known from television and award-season breakouts and making them household names or reviving the public's perception of them. There's been a certain tier of actors who first broke box office records and sold magazine covers in the '90s — Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Jolie — who have somehow managed to avoid being in a superhero film. But it now seems as though everyone must do at least one. Despite being a favorite for numerous superhero roles since the '90s and being an early rumored choice to direct Captain Marvel, Jolie has stayed away from superhero movies. Sure, she played Lara Croft twice and starred in the comic adaptation of Wanted (2008), which stripped away the superhero element of Mark Millar's comic, and she went all-in on the costumed villainess in Maleficent (2014) and its upcoming sequel. But she's never played a true superhero before.","Yet Sersi, if speculation is indeed correct, seems like a fitting choice for Jolie. Not only does the role provide her with the opportunity to work with Zhao, whose film The Rider (2017) makes the filmmakers seem like kindred spirits, but Sersi reflects many of Jolie's own acting choices and interests.\n\nCreated by Jack Kirby, Sersi first appeared in Strange Tales No. 109 (1963), with the name spelled \"Circe,\" then later as Sersi in The Eternals No. 3 (1976). The distinction in spelling highlights a very important aspect of The Eternals' comic book history. While Greek gods and goddesses exist in the Marvel Universe, they would often let the Olympia-based Eternals represent their physical forms for the humans on Earth, hence many of the Eternals sharing names similar to their Greek counterparts. This distinction sounds like something the MCU will merge and just make the Eternals the inspiration for the Greek Pantheon, like the Asgardians were the basis for the Norse Gods. The comics have already done some of this synthesizing. Sersi inspired the poet Homer, who included her under the name Circe in The Odyssey in which she turned men into swine. Because of her powers to manipulate matter and rearrange molecular structures, she was often seen as a witch rather than a result of alien experimentation, allowing her to move across comic book genres.","While most of the Eternals eventually returned to the cosmos in search of their larger destiny, Sersi remained on Earth, fascinated with its people and customs. She involved herself in key moments in history, lived in ancient Rome and Camelot, fought alongside Thor and the Vikings in the god's youth and later joined the Avengers.\n\nHaving lived for millennia, Sersi has taken on many roles on Earth and has changed her personality as she's seen fit, taking the most out of her immortal existence. This worldliness and interest in alleviating human conflict and suffering falls in line with Jolie's own humanitarian and conservation efforts. As the line between actors and the superheroes they play grows increasingly thin (see Chris Evans' political interests, and Gal Gadot and Brie Larson's movement for women in film), Sersi may be a way for Jolie to get her message out to a wider audience, and exhibit godlike powers while doing it.","It's impossible to capture the massive potential and mythology of The Eternals through one character and casting choice. But Jolie's involvement at least gives us a better idea of what's coming down the road post-Avengers: Endgame. Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige has promised a very different MCU after April 26, and if Jolie's casting and Sersi's eons-spanning history and mythology is any indication, Marvel's storytelling and casting is only growing in ambition.","Richard Newby","Heat Vision","'Us': Jordan Peele Has a Secret Backstory for the Tethered","Do 'Avengers: Endgame' Flashbacks Reveal How It All Ends?","Is Ezra Miller the Screenwriter 'The Flash' Needs?","© 2019 The Hollywood Reporter\n\nAll rights reserved.","The Hollywood Reporter, LLC is a subsidiary of Prometheus Global Media, LLC.","Terms of Use |\nPrivacy |\nSitemap |\nAbout Our Ads","Our affiliate publications"],"targetCaptions":[]}

After all, she was an instant fan favorite after her appearance in Black Panther, held a fairly important role in Avengers: Infinity War and was even confirmed by Angela Bassett (who plays her mother, Queen Ramonda) to have survived the Snap.","When asked about whether she or her on-screen daughter died, the actress said the following last year:","“No. Neither did my daughter. Shuri, she’s a bright girl there in Wakanda. So…”","Well, it looks like Bassett was telling porkies, because we now know that Shuri, unfortunately, perished in the Snap that also took out a number of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. We know this as Marvel released a new batch of character posters today which made it very clear who’s currently dead and who’s still among the living, and it seems Letitia Wright’s fan favorite wasn’t one of the lucky ones.","See for yourself below:","MORE FROM THE WEB","While upsetting, this isn’t too surprising to learn. After all, if Shuri hadn’t been dusted, you think she would’ve made her presence known pretty sharpish. That she hasn’t makes it clear that she was another of Thanos’ billions of casualties. This also kills all those theories that told us we’d see her taking on the mantle of Black Panther as the surviving heroes battle to resurrect their friends.","All that being said, we’re fairly confident that Shuri will return in Avengers: Endgame along with the rest of the heroes who met their end in Infinity War. We already know that Marvel has big plans for her down the road, after all, and we can’t wait to see her back in action when the film opens big next month, on April 26th.","MORE NEWS FROM THE WEB","TRENDING","You May Like…","Familiar Faces Return In First Fear The Walking Dead Season 5 Trailer","X-Men: Dark Phoenix Producer Says Disney Deal Isn’t Why The Franchise Is Ending","The Mandalorian Reportedly Expected To Land A Second Season","Zoe Saldana Breaks The Silence On James Gunn’s Return To Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3","David Ramsey Reportedly Leaving The Arrowverse This Season Or Next","New Avengers: Endgame Toy Confirms Thanos’ Attack On [SPOILERS]","Another New Weapon’s Been Revealed For Thanos In Avengers: Endgame","2021 Is Looking To Be The Biggest Year For Star Trek Ever","Why The Original Iron Man Still Holds Up After More Than A Decade","Mark Hamill Previews Chucky’s New Voice For Child’s Play Reboot","Avengers: Endgame Ticket On-Sale Date Finally Confirmed","New Aladdin Trailer Invites Us To Explore A Whole New World","Arrow Producers Release Statement On Emily Bett Rickards’ Exit","New Avengers: Endgame LEGO Sets Launch With Tons Of Spoilers","Avengers: Endgame Funko Pop!

Sandberg-directed film has finally lifted, allowing film critics to reveal their full thoughts on the superhero flick. As it stands now, reviews look generally positive across the board, with many critics praising the movie's comedic tone and Zachary Levi's performance of the titular character.","ComicBook.com's Brandon Davis loved the film, calling it the \"best movie based on a DC Comics character since The Dark Knight changed the comic book movie game in 2008.\" Keep scrolling to see the reactions from other critics around the industry!","Shazam! hits theaters April 5th.

Christopher Nolan's film probably still holds the torch for best film in the genre given its ability to transcend the comic book movie world and become a psychological thriller, above all else, but Shazam! certainly gives the film a run for its money. It's the sheer levels of fun, heart, and terror Shazam! masterfully balances which make it a lightning bolt of joy.\"","Read the full review here.","\"“Shazam!” is hardly the first comic-book film to adopt a tone of breezy postmodern irreverence. The “Deadpool” movies, with their Mad-magazine snake-tongued nihilism, got there a while back, and before them there was Robert Downey Jr.’s ironic-quip-spewing Tony Stark, and if you go back to the 1978 “Superman,” part of that film’s timeless charm is that it was already too late in the 20th century to play Clark Kent’s Adonis-in-glasses stumblebum gawkiness entirely straight (and Christopher Reeve’s performance was pure screwball). “Flash Gordon,” in 1980, presented its space-jock hero as a delicious beefcake joke (the fact that you could scarcely tell whether Sam J. Jones was an actor or a high-school gym teacher was part of it). And then, of course, there was “Batman,” the ’60s TV series that started it all — a show that had its tongue planted so firmly in its face mask that it practically invented the mainstreaming of camp.\"","Read the full review here.","\"Shazam! is a DC’s most joyful and sweet movie since the days of Christopher Reeve’s Superman, a funny yet earnest coming-of-age story about a boy who learns that, well, with great power comes great responsibility. So obviously, Shazam! doesn’t reinvent the superhero movie, but it’s an undeniably fun time that left me wanting more big-screen adventures with these charming characters.\"","Read the full review here.","\"This may prompt angry emails, but here it goes anyway: Shazam has always been a third-tier superhero, in my opinion. Then again, a year ago I would have said the same thing about Aquaman, and look what happened to him. These days, even the bottom of the barrel can be strip-mined for gold, it seems. Which brings us to DC’s new and mostly improved Shazam 2.0. Written by Henry Gayden and directed by Annabelle: Creation’s David F. Sandberg, Shazam! is a lot jokier and zippier than the spandex tentpoles we’ve come to expect from DC’s often-lugubrious stable of cinematic superheroes. The credit for that almost entirely goes to Zachary Levi (Chuck), who plays the title character with an infectiously naïve, gee-whiz charisma that calls to mind Tom Hanks in Big more than anything.\"","Read the full review here.","\"With or without the name, the spirit of the old Captain Marvel adventures is very much at the heart of Shazam!, even amid a lot of just-barely PG-13 violence and a couple of gags about a strip club. That’s part of what makes it such a gleeful alternative both to the grimness of past DC films — a tone the company seems eager to shed — and the cosmos-in-the-balance stakes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Whether played by Angel or Levi, Billy is just a kid. It’s fun to watch him take delight in his new powers, and a little frightening to realize how little control he has over them. And where Batson’s earliest comics adventures gave him a big city to treat as a playground, Shazam! does the same with Philadelphia. His pleasure at bouncing around the city proves infectious, even though he always seems to be on the verge of accidentally leveling a city block.\"","Read the full email here.","\"These days, superhero movies need a little something extra to make them stand out from the pack. They can’t just be a typical, big-budget, flashy action movie. There needs to be a certain level of humor, pathos, or some poignant commentary that takes the film to the next level. In the case of David F. Sandberg’s new DC movie Shazam, that’s exactly what happens, by hiding a movie about the power and importance of foster families inside a sometimes-silly superhero origin story.\"","Read the full review here.","\"Admittedly, Billy is not the original Shazam’s ideal candidate. But the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) has recently unleashed the Seven Deadly Sins—monstrous gargoyles that hearken back to the special effects of films like Ghosterbusters II—and is poised to take over the world. Like Billy, Sivana was once taken away to Shazam’s lair as a child, but failed the wizard’s test, as have hundreds since. With no time to keep looking for a more fitting replacement, the bearded sorcerer imbues Billy with his magic before crumbling to dust. Now, all he has to do is say his name, “Shazam,” and he’ll be transformed into an adult superhero (Zachary Levi) in an old-fashioned puff of lighting and smoke. The movie knows that this is all eye-rollingly silly; at first, Billy can’t even say the word with a straight face.\"","Read the full review here.","of","'Shazam!'

A previous version mistakenly described Mr Shapiro as an “alt-right sage” and “a pop idol of the alt right”. In fact, he has been strongly critical of the alt-right movement. We apologise.","EVERYTHING ABOUT Ben Shapiro is polished. His answers are smooth. His appearance is neat. His academic pedigree is impeccable. He blasted into the public sphere at the tender age of 20 with his first book, “Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America’s Youth”, that made him a hero to many young conservatives.","Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.","After a stint at Breitbart, the veritable headquarters of right-wing media, he created his own outlet, The Daily Wire, catering to hyperventilating conservatives. At 35, his seventh book was published this month, “The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great” (Broadside Books). In it, he argues that the dismissal of Judeo-Christian values and the Greek tradition of reason leads to subjectivism and individualism that is behind the West’s social and political malaise.","His views are classically religious-conservative. He suggests that transgender people suffer a “mental disorder”; he opposes same-sex couples raising children; he has said (and sort of retracted) that “Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage.”","Mr Shapiro not only courts controversy, he relies on it. It serves as an opening salvo to be heard above the din in digital media. Once the spotlight is on, he fights his way out with nuance and intellect. “If I can use the methodologies of gaining eyeballs to get people to look into deeper content, then I’m going to do that,” he tells The Economist.","Mr Shapiro discusses Western values, freedom of speech, why he is only “sometimes Trump” and the criticism that he is Islamophobic, in an interview with Anne McElvoy for The Economist Asks podcast and our Open Future initiative. The podcast is available below. It is followed by condensed portions of the interview.","*  *   *","The Economist: In your latest book you spend a lot of time talking about what’s going wrong in society. What do you think has been eroded?","Ben Shapiro: What is eroding is the fundamental principles upon which the civilisation is based. The idea that each of us are individuals made in the image of God; that we each have individual value; that we can use reason to have discussions with one another, which is the fundamental underlying assumption for free speech and for democracy; the idea that as individuals we have rights that are independent of the government providing those rights.","All of those values are being eroded because, first of all, we got rid of some of the assumptions, or at least we’ve fought some of the religious underpinnings of the West. And then in turn, we’ve fought back against the notion of reason itself. And we’re reverting to a sort of tribalism we see in our politics that's getting quite ugly.","The Economist: It’s a faith-based argument, fundamentally. But if we look at that argument— whether it’s the Judeo bit or the Christian bit —many people simply interpret those ideas differently. They have done throughout history; they do so the more in pluralist societies. So you’re on slightly shifting ground aren't you from the get-go?","Mr Shapiro: Well, not really. The argument that I make is that there are certain fundamental principles that have always been held and have not always been fulfilled in Judeo-Christian values. And those are in tension with—and rubbing up against but mutually buttressing, counterintuitively—the ideas of reason. The whole point of the book is not that everybody needs to go back to church alone. It’s that we all need to use the ideas that were also brought to us by the Greeks, and balance those, and use them in tension, with the ideas that were brought to us by Judeo-Christian ideals.","I’m not claiming that a sort of theocracy is the purpose of life. My point is that there are certain religious fundamental principles that were created by Judeo-Christian value-systems. And that those struggled with, and occasionally gain dominance over—in unfortunate ways—reason itself. And then reason gained dominance over religion, and that had similarly unfortunate effects.","I say in the conclusion to the book that civilisations that discard Judeo-Christian values end up in really dark places. And civilisations that discard reason end up in similarly dark places. I think that the mistake of secular humanism is to believe, like the French Revolution believed, that you “strangle the last king with the entrails of the last priest,” and that what arises is some sort of glorious utopia. I don’t think that that’s correct. I think that you have to understand where it is that we have come from, so that we can actually take what is good from what we’ve had and maintain that and cherish that.","The Economist: A lot of things that made the West great in terms of wealth and subsequent power can’t always be easily defined as moral in the sense that you’ve laid out. We have empires built in large part, for instance, on slavery.","Mr Shapiro: Of course that’s true. It’s also true that slavery is a universal human institution until its abolition essentially by the Judeo-Christian West.","The Economist: Yeah, but it took quite a while, didn’t it?","Mr Shapiro: Of course it took quite a while. And that of course it’s a great moral evil. The argument I’m making is not that civilisation was suddenly brought into being at one moment in time and then progress stopped. The argument of the book is that there are these principles that are in constant turmoil with each other, and that the interplay between these principles creates the West. And that to ignore some of those principles, to read some of those principles out of history, to assume that those principles can be destroyed at will, and that we can maintain the upper levels of a building whose foundations we’ve just done away with—I think that’s a mistake.","The Economist: You talk about this new social fabric. What is the solution? What would the new social fabric look like? How would we know if we had begun to recreate it in the way that you think would be beneficial?","Mr Shapiro: We have to have a common definition of what liberty constitutes, what choice constitutes, and we also have to rebuild a lot of the social institutions that have collapsed. Now, historically those have been churches—just realistically speaking, the place where most people found their common cause and common meaning was in churches. But social science research says they don’t only have to be churches. They can be social clubs. They can be bowling leagues; other ways of reaching out to each other.","But the more durable those ways are of reaching out to each other, the more we can, at the same time, maintain our individuality, and also see the common humanity in the other. It is the sort of point that Robert Putnam makes in “Bowling Alone”. The Harvard sociologist, he makes the point that diversity itself is not necessarily a strengthening factor in a society, but when there is a society that has a common purpose, then the diversity definitely helps the society.","One of the things we’ve seen in the West is—as multiculturalism has come to the fore—the attempt to shatter the common purpose, and then maintain that diversity, and expect that all you’ll get is benefit, I think is a bit foolhardy.","The Economist: You have a big following. You’re laying out a stall here. You’re taking on some ideas that you’ve embraced over the years, and what you’ve written now. Why should we listen to you? What is different about your perspective or authority?","Mr Shapiro: All the stuff that I think we generally agree is good in the West: freedom, liberalism, democracy, human rights. An extraordinarily prosperous economy—we live at the most prosperous free time in the history of humanity. How did those things come about?","Because the question isn’t “What bad things did Western civilization do” alone. I mean, we should obviously look at this stuff; that stuff is important. But I think it’s important to note that the great difference that has happened in the world is the West.","If you believe that the West has had a generalised beneficial and salutary impact on the world, particularly over the last few centuries, we’re going to have to look at the values that inspired that, because that is something that’s different.","The Economist: But we also have to look at the challenges within it. […] Isn’t the conversation about privilege, about prosperity, about the gains of prosperity and who shares them? Isn't that just a very old religious message, which is that we ought to look after those weaker than ourselves, and to keep thinking about it proactively. Therefore, what the West stands for must keep looking at itself and must keep changing.","Mr Shapiro: I certainly agree that the basic notion of fairness itself is sort of embedded in the human mind—a notion of fairness that I largely believe is incorrect, which is the fairness of outcome. With that said, there is nothing in basic religious theology that suggests that just because somebody is successful and somebody else is not successful, that some sort of cosmic injustice has been done.","In secular countries, what we’ve seen is the attempt to supplant a religious-based social fabric with a governmental fabric. The idea being that we all agree that we have to take care of our neighbors. As a religious person, I want to care for my neighbor; it’s a biblical injunction. That’s not the same thing as suggesting that an overarching government has the power to confiscate wealth from some and give it to others.","The Economist: Well, the disagreement over that points sits right at the heart of the political debate in America. You lament the fact that it’s become so acrimonious. You’ve said, “Politics has become a blood sport.” So, what can be done about that?","Mr Shapiro: I think that the first thing that can be done is to recognise that we actually do in the West share a lot more in common than separates us. I think that we have to agree on some fundamental principles: the idea of freedom of speech; the idea that speech is not violence; the notion that we can convince each other with argumentation; that reason actually matters. If we agree on all of those things, and then we are willing to grant the other side of the debate the credibility to make its arguments, then we are likely to have a less acrimonious debate.","I think one of the things that has happened is that we have decided that, thanks to narratives of victimisation and privilege—some of which are rooted in real history, but I think draw bad conclusions—what we’ve decided instead is that we have to argue from identity, as opposed to arguing from the notion that we are all individual human beings that have the capacity for reason.","The Economist: It seems quite odd to hear people arguing for an end or smoothing over of division who, it seems to me, you quite like division. You like pitching into the argument, often in very strong terms, which some people find divisive and think simply amplifies that sort of “screaming chamber”. Are you a bit guilty of the very thing that you say you want to cure?","Mr Shapiro: You know, I’m sure I am. I am trying to work on it. You know, one of the things that…","The Economist: Give us the evidence that you are working on it! What are you working on?","Mr Shapiro: Well, I mean I think that the book is one attempt. But if you look at the fact that I have reached out to many folks on the left to have discussions. If you look at my actual college appearances and not just the two-minute clipped YouTube “Shapiro destroys” kind of stuff, but you actually look at the exchanges. These are very sober, rational, non-demonising discussions.","The Economist: And are you saying that you disown that kind of way of handling clips or of promoting that you rely on—I’m sure we’ll hear it after this show, as others: “Shapiro destroys McElvoy”! Or AOC. Or whoever it is…","Mr Shapiro: Let’s put it this way: Is that what I want from the debate? No. Is that a way of getting people to watch deeper content? Sure. I mean, we also have to acknowledge how the market works, and the market does work in a way to generate these sorts of views on those sorts of videos. We don’t make the vast majority of those. And when I have control of it I try to downplay that sort of stuff. I also make distinctions between various political factions.","But this sort of idea here is that we do live in a fraught political time, and if I can use the methodologies of gaining eyeballs to get people to look into deeper content, then I’m going to do that, as opposed to simply disengaging from the realities of the political world. Now with all of that said, I do think there is a large-scale difference between the kind of partisan bickering that we’re talking about and the actual tribal political warfare that we’re seeing.","The Economist: What is the responsibility of people with particularly influential presence on social-media platforms? To be fair to say that you are one of them: Do you have any moral responsibility to diminish divisions?","Mr Shapiro: Only where the divisions are bad faith divisions. What I do have a responsibility to do is say that these are discussions that we can have about issues. That I am not divided from Bernie Sanders by virtue of my background. That I’m not a member of a tribe that prevents us from having a conversation in the first place.","The sort of tribal politics that we are seeing, and that I think does in some ways escalate toward violence, is a politics where we say, “You cannot have a discussion with me because you have not had my experiences”. The intersectional politics of the United States is really dangerous and it’s not just on the left side of the aisle. It’s on the right side of the aisle, as well.","The Economist: You use quite out-there language. You’ve talked about debunking the “myth” of the tiny, radical Muslim minority in a video that was criticised quite widely as being Islamophobic. Do you sometimes stand back and say, “I might have gone too far?”","Mr Shapiro: I mean sure. I think any good person has to sit there and think—whenever something terrible happens, or even when something not terrible is happening—be self-critical and try to determine: Could I have done better here?","The particular video that you’re citing is a complete recitation of Pew Research Statistics. So that particular video being used as evidence that I’m Islamophobic, when I’m literally just reading poll results, I've always found to be kind of shocking.","I’ve always found shocking also the notion that if you criticise radical Islam, or if you criticise views that are radical, that this is somehow you justifying the murder of innocent people who are not radical, or justifying murder on the basis of views itself. That’s a jump that I don't see anyone rational making. But you know, there are a lot of rational people who want to connect speech with violence.","The Economist: Let’s come to a saying that you were very famous for: “Facts don’t care about your feelings”. But we might say in the last three years voters on left and right have rather abandoned technocratic politics or so-called evidence-based politics in favor of something else; something more urgent, more direct, something more populist. Wouldn’t it be more accurate to say that modern politics is about feelings, and feelings don’t care that much about facts.","Mr Shapiro: Yeah, I think that’s a more accurate statement of where we are politically. I think what we’ve seen is a failure to acknowledge that we live in a shared reality, and that facts have to be the basis of any contention that we’re making. Instead, we are happy to draw emotionally manipulative narratives from isolated incidents, or alternatively to ignore broad trends of facts in favour of particular narratives. That obviously is dangerous stuff. I hope that I’m the kind of person—I try to be the kind of person—who can be convinced by evidence that I’m wrong.","But I at least try to be evidence-based in my politics. I hope that we can all be a little bit more evidence-based in our politics.","The Economist: What about President Trump? You’ve said you are “sometimes Trump”. What determines actually which days you’re feeling Trump-y and which days you feel a bit anti-Trump?","Mr Shapiro: It depends. If you do something dumb or horrible that day. I mean that’s really what it comes down to. When I say “Sometimes Trump,” what I mean is that he is the President of the United States, in this case. I would say I was “Sometimes Obama” meaning that if Obama did something that I liked—which was exceedingly rare—then I was a fan of it. It's the same thing.","So when President Trump says very foolish or counterproductive things, then that’s bad. When he nominates a Supreme Court justice who says that he will hew to the original meaning of the Constitution, then that's good. I’m not going to criticise him when I think he’s doing something right. I’m not going to ignore it when I think he’s doing something wrong.","The Economist: How is the 2020 American presidential election looking to you?","Mr Shapiro: If I had to give odds right now, I’d say that President Trump is an odds-on favorite to lose in 2020. I think that he only has about a 40% chance of winning.","The Economist: What’s changed; what's gone so wrong on the right in America, if this president upended all these liberal expectations only has a 40% chance of winning again?","Mr Shapiro: I think that it hasn’t gone better because in part, President Trump is President Trump. He’s a polarising figure. He didn’t take advantage of the opportunity of the presidency to grow his base. He didn’t take an opportunity to look like a more compassionate person, if [he] were capable of that. He didn’t educate the public on all of the things he's done right. He’s distracted the public with all of the things he’s done wrong.","If somebody could have smashed his phone the day he took office and he had not tweeted for the last two and a half years, then I think that his approval rating would be five to 10 points higher. But he’s a constant obstacle in his own way.","The Economist: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?","Mr Shapiro: I don’t think Ocasio-Cortez has any national appeal. I think that she’s very appealing to the media. I think she’s very appealing to a small base of very radical left-wingers. But she does encompass exactly what the media are looking for, which is a person who is quite attractive in her presentation, who looks like she’s having fun—which is half the battle—with her Instagram stuff, and who is also deeply radical, and boils down complex arguments to bumper stickers, like ‘em or hate ‘em.","The Economist: Do you respect her?","Mr Shapiro: In what sense?","The Economist: Politically.","Mr Shapiro: No. I don’t respect her politics. I don’t respect her intellectual command of the issues. I respect that she’s been able to command enormous amounts of media attention. But no, I think that she’s a bad expositor of her own values.","The Economist: I can’t resist a last, quick-fire round if you'll just bear with me. Your dream date with a moral philosopher? And I'm going to allow you an “alive or dead”.","Mr Shapiro: Oh, OK, wow. On the religious side, you know I’m a religious Jew, so that means you’re almost obligated religiously to say “Moses”. But putting aside religious philosophers, the two that come to mind immediately—well, three—that come to mind immediately, are Aquinas, Maimonides, and Locke.","The Economist: That's quite a date. That’s a heavy night out, isn’t it?","Mr Shapiro: We’ll do some round-robin. Ten-minute dating. It’ll be a party.","The Economist: Shots with Locke! Nightmare date: the one that wouldn’t work out?","Mr Shapiro: Certainly a date with Marx would go very poorly. Number one because he was not fond of the Jews. And number two, he was wrong about pretty much everything.","The Economist: Last one. You talk about God: he, she or it?","Mr Shapiro: Well, I mean, “it” in the technical sense; “he” in the homologic sense.","The Economist: Noted.","Open Future","by K.N.C. & A.M.","Brexit and ParliamentTheresa May loses again, again","Intimidating the prosecutorRomania appears to be so afraid of Laura Codruta Kovesi that it indicted her","Ecumenism in AmericaThe Trump era has exposed divisions among Catholics and evangelicals","Daily chartMPs’ Brexit votes reveal myriad divisions among the Tories","Join them.

The political motivations are clear. The new state — for which they propose the unwieldy name “State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth” — would be reliably Democratic, adding two senators and one representative to the party’s totals.","There are plenty of reasons to oppose this precise solution, but the issue of taxpaying Americans’ not having a representative voice in Congress is not easily dismissed. And if Congress wants to address that issue, Puerto Rico, not the District of Columbia, should become our 51st state.","Republicans have reason to support such a move along with Democrats. The GOP party platform has favored Puerto Rican statehood for decades, but Republicans have remained wary of acting on the issue, convinced that Puerto Rico, like D.C., would be a reliably blue state. That’s not exactly true. Puerto Rico had a Republican-affiliated governor as recently as 2013, and its current nonvoting delegate to Congress, Jenniffer González-Colón, is a Republican. If Puerto Rico became a state, it is reasonable to believe that González-Colón or another Republican would take one of the island’s two seats in the Senate.","Puerto Rican statehood, besides being the right thing to do on the merits, would also enhance the nation’s appreciation of federalism and further entrench the conservative value of local control. Puerto Rico differs in significant ways from the rest of the United States, but this should be seen as an asset, not a liability. Admitting it to the union would increase diversity among the states, forcing us to question whether one-size-fits-all federal laws are the best way to govern an increasingly varied people.","Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony from its discovery by Christopher Columbus in 1493 until Spain ceded it to the United States after the Spanish-American War in 1899. Other parts of the United States were once Spanish colonies, including Florida and the entire Southwest.","Those lands were sparsely populated, though, which meant that an influx of English-speaking Americans overwhelmed the existing Spanish and Native American populations, making them demographically similar to the rest of the country relatively quickly.","This was not the case in Puerto Rico. The island’s population at annexation was nearly 1 million, and while some English-speaking people moved to the new colony, they were always a minority. (Even today, roughly 95 percent of Puerto Rico residents speak Spanish as their primary language.) There were religious differences at annexation, too, as the island was majority-Catholic while the rest of the United States was overwhelmingly Protestant, despite several decades of heavy immigration from Catholic countries in Europe.","These differences may have accounted, along with then-prevailing racial prejudices, for the ambiguous status of Puerto Rico within the American nation. In 1917, Congress extended American citizenship to anyone born on the island after 1898. In doing so, it recognized that the island was a permanent part of America, while also conveniently allowing draft-age men there to be conscripted as the nation entered the First World War.","Under a constitution adopted in 1952, Puerto Rico chose to continue the ambiguous status quo. In that document, the island is called a “commonwealth,” and the term has come to signify the relationship that exists between Puerto Rico and the federal government — a free, associated state whose people are Americans but lack some of the political rights of Americans who live in the 50 states. After five referendums with varying wording and results, that relationship continues to this day.","In 2017, Puerto Rican voters chose statehood in a referendum on the island’s status. It was the fifth referendum in the past 50 years, but, owing perhaps to its low-turnout or perhaps to Congress’s reluctance, no offer of statehood was extended by the federal government, nor did the Puerto Rican government formally request a change in status from free association to full membership in the American union.","That leaves the exact legal status of Puerto Rico in limbo, but the island and its residents are without a doubt a part of America. Puerto Ricans are Americans. They serve in our military and contribute to our nation. Yet they lack the voting rights that Americans in the 50 states take for granted. Statehood would rectify that problem, integrating Puerto Rico more closely into the nation of which it is already a part.","These points have all been made before by statehood advocates, and they alone would justify granting statehood to Puerto Rico. What is often unsaid is that making Puerto Rico the 51st state would also be good for the rest of America in one specific way: It would remind us why we are a federal republic.","Modern advocates of unitary government like to say that states are meaningless nowadays, that the differences between them are so minute that there is no point in honoring them. This was not the attitude of the Founding Fathers, many of whom found even the limited central government imposed by the Constitution to be threatening to the local distinctions between what had originally been separate colonies.","It seems trivial to point out now, but there were serious cultural differences among the 13 colonies even when all were majority-Protestant and majority-English. Puritan Massachusetts, Quaker Pennsylvania, and Anglican South Carolina did not view themselves as the same. Sizable ethnic (the Dutch in New York, the Germans in Pennsylvania) and religious (the Catholics in Maryland) minorities added to colonial diversity. Federalism, though primarily a political measure, also worked to preserve these unique subcultures of early America.","As the nation grew, the states became more diverse. Louisiana was a French colony when the United States acquired it in 1803, and that distinctive colonial heritage still flavors the culture and the law there today. The Southwest, as already mentioned, was historically Spanish, and Hawaii had a long history as an independent kingdom before being annexed by the United States in 1898. Although our nation’s cultural differences are less acute than they once were, thanks to internal migration and homogenized mass media, the states still vary from one another. Federalism helps maintain that variation within a united republic.","Federalism would help preserve Puerto Rico’s culture even as the island would become more deeply integrated with the rest of America. Indeed, Puerto Rico’s representatives in Congress would probably call for guarantees of federalism to make sure of that. Although many in the Republican party believe that the island would be thoroughly Democratic as a state, Puerto Rican politicians would not be keen on the national Democratic party’s penchant for consolidating power in Washington, D.C.","To see how federalism would look if Puerto Rico were admitted as a state, we need only examine our neighbor to the north, Canada.","In most respects, Canadians are just like Americans: a majority-English-speaking, majority-Protestant people living in a collection of former British colonies. The exception to the rule is Quebec. When Canada began the gradual process of securing independence from the United Kingdom, federalism was seen as the only way to unite the English-speaking Protestant provinces with the French-speaking Catholic one. And while the differences between Catholic and Protestant are less important to most people nowadays, the differences between French- and English-speaking Canadians remain and have helped preserve the federal nature of Canada’s union when other centralizing, progressive trends in Canadian politics might have destroyed it.","Even when Canada’s government is to the left of ours, federalism is maintained, with foreign affairs and economic policy mostly handled in Ottawa and cultural and educational matters dealt with at the provincial level. We think of Canada and the U.K. as both having socialized health care, and that’s true. But the two systems are not managed the same way. Britain’s National Health Service is the sort of top-down model that conservatives in this country fear; Canada’s model is managed by the provinces, not unlike our Medicare system. Both systems would probably entail too much government intrusion for most Americans, but the Canadian version offers more local control, and works better, than Britain’s.","Changes in Canadian governance over the years have involved negotiations between the provinces and the federal government. Disputes over federalism led to conventions between provinces, not just debates in the federal legislature. In the Meech Lake Accord in 1987 and the Charlottetown Accord in 1992, these compromises failed, but even failure in such a scenario is better than huge top-down reforms rammed through without regard for local concerns.","A more diverse conglomeration of states would likely lead to similar demands for more local autonomy, which could not come at a better time. The United States government has grown too big and centralized to be controlled by a single executive. Greater variation in geography, size, and culture among the states would force us to appreciate anew the need for federalism and might even lead to a more clearly defined division of powers between the different sovereignties, as found in Part VI of Canada’s 1867 constitution.","A century of drift away from the American Constitution’s vital federalist principles has left them ripe for rediscovery and renewal. Adding a new state to the Union, especially one already accustomed to remaining culturally distinct within the American nation, would spur that process forward. Congress should admit Puerto Rico as a state, and Americans as a whole should embrace the differences within our nation and the federal structure that allows them to coexist in peace.","More in Politics & Policy","Replacing Obamacare Is Still a Republican Duty","The 2020 Election Conundrum","The Nationalism Show","Happy National Border Control Day","Top Stories","NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.","Photo Essays","Brexit Demonstrations","Boeing 737 MAX Factory","F-22 Raptor Rollout","Recommended Articles","Most Popular","In Us, the Woke Generation Scares Itself","Tucker Carlson Laments America’s Cultural Decline: ‘Why Is This Happening?’","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Says Bartending Helped Her Recognize Cohen’s Lies","The Dangers of Unchecked Nationalism","Dan Crenshaw Warns of ‘the New Socialism’","Democrats Take a Nonsensical Approach to Climate Change","Collusion Clingers and Their Flat-Earth Forebears","Around the Web","America's Innovation Boom","No Justice For Jussie","GOP Senators Running in 2020 Face Loyalty Test","The Brexit Breakup Gets Messier","© 2019 National Review","Newsletters","© 2019 National Review"],"targetCaptions":[]}

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. For an explanation of our Advertising Policy, visit this page.","We’re partnering with Capital One on our Purposeful Travel Hub. If you have unique ways you like to give back when you travel or just love exploring new places with family and friends, we want to hear about it. Share your most treasured travel moments and purposeful travel tips with us using #MeaningfulMoments.","There are plenty of reasons you should travel. You get to experience new cultures, step out of your comfort zone, and become a better global citizen. But, if there’s one time in particular you should make it a point to travel, it’s before a major life event.","“Vacation and travel are designed to be a rest, break or variation from our normal lives,” Lindsay Henderson, a psychologist who treats patients virtually via the telehealth app, LiveHealth Online, told The Points Guy. This can be particularly valuable around periods of transition in life, as travel allows for the time and space to reflect and recharge. It can also contribute to personal growth and development that we need and crave during times of transition.”","After all, there’s a reason things like honeymoons and babymoons exist. Major life changes come with a lot of excitement and positive anticipation. But, they also come with a lot of stress and anxiety. Having a child, graduating from college (or seeing your kids off to school), and getting married: These are all moments that alter your life tremendously. And it’s for that very reason you should consider taking a trip before those milestones.","And no, you don’t have to empty your savings account (or cash out all your points) for one of these benchmark getaways. The important thing about your trip, even if it’s a short drive from home or an inexpensive weekend away, is that you take time to relax, unwind and reflect on whatever change is coming your way.","1. Before Having a Baby","Babymoons have become incredibly popular recently (think: the Bahamas in January, or Hawaii in May). After all, who wouldn’t want to get away and rest up before the months of sleepless nights ahead? But, more than enjoying some downtime before the chaos, it’s also a chance to focus on yourself and your relationship.","“When you have a baby, your life changes dramatically,” Jenn Mann, author of The Relationship Fix, told TPG. “Particularly when it comes to babies and women, your whole life focus changes, especially for a first baby. When you go from being single or a couple to being a [parent], you spend the first three years focusing on the needs of this little being, and not yourself. A babymoon is an opportunity to have a last hurrah of that life, and it puts gasoline in the tank of your romantic life with your partner to make it through the rough times.”","2. After Graduating From School","Backpacking through Europe after finishing college is almost a rite of passage at this point. Why? That time is some of the most pivotal in anyone’s life.","“It is rare to have the luxury of time once entering the workforce,” said Henderson. “So, there may be no better opportunity to spend several weeks backpacking around Europe or Asia than after college graduation. Taking in the sights, sounds and experiences of the places you adventure to are critical for getting the most of travel, for having the travel shape who you are as a person and how you interact with the world around you moving forward.”","Mann added, “When you’re in college, you’re discovering autonomy, mastery and independence. Traveling only enhances those skills and abilities.”","3. Before Starting a New Job","It’s been dubbed the “jobbymoon,” and it’s that time between jobs when you decide to take a trip. And, according to Mann, it’s a great idea.  “It’s so rare these days to have time where you have few or no obligations,” she said. “So, in between jobs when you’re relieved of those demands and day-to-day stress, it’s a great opportunity to travel — if you can afford it — before jumping right into the next gig.”","Plus, sometimes being in between jobs isn’t always a choice. If you were let go, taking a trip is still a good idea. “It turns a negative into a positive,” said Mann. “You now have positive memories associated with the job loss [rather] than negative ones.”","4. When You’re Getting Married","Weddings are a lot of fun. They’re also a lot of work. After all, there are invitations, bands, family requests and floral arrangements to worry about. Sometimes, obsessing over the details of the wedding can actually throw you off from remembering the reason why you’re getting hitched in the first place. What better way to be reminded of that than by taking a little getaway before walking down the aisle with your partner to disconnect from the marital madness and reconnect with each other?","“Wedding planning is incredibly stressful, and most people don’t realize how stressful it is,” said Mann. “It’s one of those things where stepping away puts things in perspective, which is a real positive. It gives you time to focus on the connection instead of the planning.”","Plus, we can think of at least one celeb who kickstarted the trend. So, you know it’s a good idea.","Of course, there’s nothing wrong with the traditional post-wedding honeymoon. Although honeymoons have been around for a while, the reasoning for taking one has shifted slightly. It used to be a trip you took with your significant other to mark the first overnights together. Now, as modern couples often travel and live together prior to their wedding day, it’s more about recovering from the stress of the planning process. And that’s important.","“Many couples may feel that their wedding is more about others than it is about them,” said Henderson. “A honeymoon can serve as the perfect [antidote] to that; an opportunity to relax in a way that is all about the newlyweds and what they want.  It is also a chance to reflect together and mark the start of your new life as a married couple. Remember: A honeymoon is not about a luxury or money able to be spent, it is about time alone to celebrate each other.”","5. When the Nest Empties","Much like traveling after college or in between jobs, taking a trip after your kids move out marks the end to a major responsibility. While that can be exciting and relieving, it’s also a big change that can bring about a lot of fear for the future. Purposefully planning a trip around that time can help dampen the sting of the change.","“Use a trip after your kids move out to mark a transition in a positive way and create a milestone event,” said Mann. “It’s a nice time to refresh and rejuvenate and be not fearful of change.”","Henderson agreed, adding, “The very act of going on vacation can be defined by temporarily taking on a new mindset, and this can be noteworthy as one is recovering from a life change. The act of recovering from or processing a change, like your grown children leaving your home, [is] best managed by giving time, space and intention to the transition. Travel can provide this.”","6. Following a Breakup","Breakups suck. But, traveling after one can be a healthy step toward beginning life without that significant other. “I’m all for a breakup vacation,” said Mann. “It’s a fantastic idea. It’s nice to have a change of scenery and be reminded of your independence.” Her advice? Pick a place you always wanted to go — and your partner didn’t. “It’s all about celebrating that you can do what you want now.”","Feature image by Kiattisak Lamchan / EyeEm / Getty Images.","Share this:","News and deals straight to your inbox every day.","SIGN-UP BONUS: 50,000 Miles","TPG'S BONUS VALUATION: $700","CARD HIGHLIGHTS: 10X miles on stays booked and paid for through Hotels.com/Venture + 2x miles on everything else.

Unlike the previous quarters, this Model 3-driven push is not only happening in the United States, with foreign territories such as Europe and China being part of the company-wide delivery efforts as well.","⚠️Important Update ⚠️March 27th 2019. Now Shanghai China 🇨🇳 is ran out of the Carriers for rental because of Tesla. Massive delivery is happening for the Q1 push. $TSLA #Tesla #China #TeslaChina #Model3 #特斯拉 #中国 #上海 pic.twitter.com/zmlB4RO8ht","This intense initiative is particularly felt in China, which only started receiving its first batches of Model 3 this quarter. Tesla is only delivering higher-cost versions of the electric sedan such as the Long Range AWD and Performance Model 3 for now, but the reception from the car buying public appears to be very positive so far.","Reports from the country’s social media platforms tell of busy Tesla galleries and fully booked test drive sessions. Sightings of car carriers transporting the Model 3 have also been shared online from multiple cities in China. One of Shanghai’s DMV offices was even flooded recently by Model 3 owners who were getting license plates for their vehicles.","Additional Pictures Update:Shanghai China 🇨🇳 Massive Tesla Model 3 Delivery.

Being the company’s first true mass-market car, the Model 3 is designed to target both the country’s upper class (with imported vehicles like the Model 3 Performance) and middle-class (with vehicles like the Standard Model 3). Tesla is yet to release any lower-cost variants of the Model 3 in China, though Gigafactory 3’s rapid progress suggests that the Asian country could welcome its first genuinely affordable, locally-produced Model 3 later this year.","Elon Musk noted during Gigafactory 3’s groundbreaking ceremony that affordable variants of the Model 3 and Model Y will be produced in China as soon as the facility is ready for vehicle production. Shanghai official Chen Mingbo estimates that the factory could be completed by May, after which it will be tooled for electric car manufacturing. Provided that everything goes well, Tesla could start producing the Model 3 in Gigafactory 3 by the end of 2019.","Post navigation","Recent Most Popular","My Tesla Model 3 wireless phone charger looks factory, plus it’s fast","A big thanks to Nomad for providing me with this Model 3 wireless phone...","Tesla’s high-stakes ‘Blitzscaling’ strategy explained by veteran tech analyst","To say that Tesla is moving fast is an understatement.

Who's to say he can't make it happen?","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["Tottenham's Harry Kane, the world's best striker, has his sights set on a career in the NFL. Who's to say he can't make it happen?","This is an ESPN FC feature.","They couldn't wait for Mondays at Larkswood Primary, in northeast London near the Essex countryside. Five or six local clubs played in the Premier League every year. After each weekend's games, the boys would come to school ready to argue about which of them was best. \"You're going back and forth with each other whenever you pick up a good result,\" Harry Kane says. \"But obviously at the time, Arsenal and Chelsea were stronger than Tottenham. Finishing higher, winning trophies.\"","In 2003, when Kane was 9, Arsenal placed second in the league and Chelsea fourth. The next season Arsenal won the title, with Chelsea right behind. The year after that, they switched places and Chelsea won.","Tottenham Hotspur? Keep looking down the table. Further down, past Fulham, past Charlton Athletic and if you've never heard of Charlton Athletic, well... that's the point. Both of those London clubs finished ahead of Spurs in 2003, and it was no aberration. The following season, they did it again. Still, Kane stayed steadfast, even when he briefly played in Arsenal's youth program. You pick a team when you're small, he explains, and often for no logical reason. If you're loyal and determined, you stick with it.","It couldn't have been easy. Year after year throughout Kane's childhood, Spurs were an afterthought, seen as another game on the schedule. Some of the better football players around had passed through White Hart Lane --  Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker, Teddy Sheringham and Jurgen Klinsmann -- but none stayed long enough to help win the league, or get close. \"People forget that, not too long ago, we were nowhere near this level,\" Kane said, sitting on a couch at the club's training grounds in Enfield, north of London, one afternoon at the beginning of March.","He's Spurs' leading scorer now and has been for four seasons, which happen to coincide with Tottenham's best run of finishes in more than half a century: third, second and third in the past three campaigns, after failing to place as high as second since 1963. They're now third again this year with eight games left. \"We've got as many points as we've ever had, I think, at this stage of the season,\" Kane added. \"We've done so much in a short space of time.\"","Kane is happy with Spurs' progress under Pochettino. \"Of course we want to go on to the next level and win the Premier League, and win trophies. But to consistently outperform teams that have always been above us shows that we're in a good place.\" Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images","Until a memorable 3-1 victory last season, Spurs hadn't won at Chelsea since the Premier League was still called the First Division, the day Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990. And until the season before that, they hadn't finished ahead of Arsenal since 1995, when Kane was 1. They've also made the Champions League three years in a row, after doing it once ever before that -- and they advanced to the quarterfinals for the third time after disposing of Borussia Dortmund. As March turns to April, they sit third in the Premier League. You can't put all those thirds in a display case, but they'd serve Kane well back at Larkswood. \"Of course we want to go on to the next level and win the Premier League, and win trophies,\" he said. \"But to consistently outperform these teams that have always been above us, it shows that we're in a good place.\"","Kane's rise has been equally dramatic. When Mauricio Pochettino became the manager in 2014, Kane was languishing on the depth chart, a perennial up-and-comer who'd gone out on four loans. Now? He's a two-time Premier League top scorer, England's captain and even a Member of the British Empire, as ordained by the queen. He's rated as a $175 million talent by Transfermarkt, a site that tracks such valuations, and ranked the No. 1 striker in the world by ESPN FC. \"He's topped everyone's expectations,\" says Roy Hodgson, now at Crystal Palace, who gave Kane his international debut in 2015 as England manager.","Incrementally each season, Kane has been pulling his team toward the top with him. As of mid-February, Spurs had even moved within hoping distance of first, five points out. Then they went to Chelsea and the 1990s kicked in. If they'd allowed only the first goal, which squirted between the legs of keeper Hugo Lloris, the loss might have been surmountable. But late in the game, defender Kieran Trippier pushed a back pass beyond the reach of the advancing Lloris and into his own net. \"Tottenham Hotspur,\" the Chelsea fans sang, \"it's happened again.\"","More from ESPN FC","The hater's guide to soccer rivalries","Inside the Ajax dream factory: where selling Frenkie de Jong is no big deal","ESPN FC home","If you've been following the Premier League, you'd know that isn't quite fair. One of the clubs Spurs has been chasing, Manchester City, is the world's richest. The other, Liverpool, bought four players for nearly $200 million during last summer's transfer window. In that same period, Spurs set a Premier League record that won't be broken by spending zero dollars. \"We are third, and we didn't invest in the last two transfer windows,\" says Pochettino.","Much of that is because of the investment in an ambitious new stadium, which Spurs owner Daniel Levy has self-funded in north London, beside where White Hart Lane stood for more than a century. \"I know very well what happened, from the inside,\" Pochettino says. \"I know very well with what we are working. But the people can't understand. They want to judge us like another team, like Arsenal or City or Liverpool or Man United.\" Before he can change what others think of Spurs, Pochettino says, he has to change what they think of themselves. Doing that, he insists, is \"even more important\" than winning a title.","So far, at least, he has Kane convinced. \"I've always said as long as the club is moving in the right direction and showing the right ambition, I want to be part of the journey,\" Kane says. But he turns 26 in July, and the world's best striker also ranks among its most ambitious. He has been patient since primary school, but even he doesn't know how much longer he can wait.","After almost an entire season of delays, Tottenham's new stadium is open for business. The U-18s beat Southampton in the first match there but Harry Kane will soon get his chance to make a mark. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images","There are players who make you gasp when you watch them, the ones who race across the field like wild horses. Then there's Harry Kane. He runs with a slight stumble, like somebody keeps pushing him from behind. Tall and gangly, he shuffles into a scrum of defenders with the ball and it's always a surprise to see him emerge with it on the other side. He isn't having a particularly impressive afternoon, you're thinking, except -- whoa! -- there's a goal with a perfectly placed header off a corner, and -- wait! -- there's another off a rifled shot with time waning. Then the game is over, Spurs have won and Kane has done simply everything.","Until recently, those who mattered didn't know what to make of Kane. He was cut from Arsenal's program as a preteen because he was \"chubby and not very athletic,\" the club's longtime youth director revealed to an Italian newspaper. He shouldn't be embarrassed about it because everyone else got Kane wrong too. After a wasted year in Watford, he ended up with Tottenham's juniors, where he'd wanted to be from the start. There too, nobody seemed to think Kane had a future except Kane himself. \"My aim was always Spurs,\" he says. \"It was playing for Spurs in the Premier League. And from the time that I was 14 or 15 and I started to get better and better, I realized it was a goal that I could actually get to. There were times when it started to look unlikely, but that was always my mindset.\"","\"It would be a wrench for him to leave Tottenham and go somewhere else. If he goes anywhere, it would be Real Madrid. He's a Real Madrid kind of player.\"","A handful of players at every academy are prized commodities, fawned over by coaches and whispered about by devoted fans. The others fill the space around them. At every level, Kane seemed to be just good enough. \"Did he look like he would be an England captain and a top international striker? You would have to say no,\" says Russell Slade, who managed Leyton Orient in 2011 during Kane's five-month stay there, playing in the third tier of English football. \"He was this skinny, gangly, 6-foot-4 17-year-old. Was he terrifically quick? Not really. But he maximized everything he had. And he had this great appetite to make a difference. He believed he could make a difference.\"","By then, Kane had already learned to cultivate his greatest skill, which is finding space to operate. Somehow, amid a crunch of defenders, he'll create enough room to receive a pass. \"He can lose you in a telephone box,\" says Slade. \"He only needs half a yard to get a shot off,\" says Jordan Pickford, the Everton goalkeeper, who plays with Kane for England. \"And when he makes half a turn, he knows where the goal is without even looking. Nine times out of 10, that shot is going to be on target. Ask any defender -- he's very, very difficult to mark.\"","It's not just about Kane as far as Tottenham's impressive form is concerned. Dele Alli, left, and Christian Eriksen, center, have contributed 10 goals and 11 assists in the league this season. Kane has 17 goals and four assists. Nick Potts/PA Images/Getty Images","Kane showed that the next season at Millwall, one level up in the Sky Bet Championship, where he played when he was 18. In 14 games, he scored seven goals and it isn't hyperbolic to say that he saved the club from relegation. Still, that wasn't enough to keep him around White Hart Lane. At the start of the 2012-13 season, he was loaned to Norwich. The following January, he moved to Leicester. Along the way, Harry Redknapp had been replaced as Tottenham's manager by Andre Villas-Boas, but it hardly mattered. Villas-Boas looked at Kane and didn't see a Premier League player either.","Kane was on loan somewhere -- he doesn't even remember where, there were so many -- when he first became aware of Tom Brady.","\"I started watching him on YouTube,\" Kane says. When he came across a documentary about the quarterback, he watched that too. \"We've had a similar path being doubted when we were younger. Maybe not being the best athletes as kids.\" In Brady, who had willed his way to stardom by refusing to accept anyone else's judgment, Kane saw a finished version of himself. \"It was quite a big inspiration,\" he adds. \"Not many people thought he'd become that good, or even play in the NFL, and he went on to become the best ever. At the time, it gave me a real boost to say, look, anything is possible. If you have that self-belief and that drive and that hunger, you can do it.\"","While Brady was winning Super Bowls, Kane played in his first Premier League game for Spurs, against Newcastle in August 2012. He'd done what he'd set out to do; then he set out to do it every week. \"He never felt he had a ceiling,\" says Tim Sherwood, who worked as Tottenham's first-team coach under Redknapp. \"He still doesn't. Like the Lionel Messis and Cristiano Ronaldos of the world. He sees himself in that company.\" Even now, it sounds ridiculously brazen. But when Villas-Boas was fired by Tottenham, Sherwood was made the manager for the rest of the 2013-14 season while Spurs wooed Pochettino. He gave Kane a chance to play. \"How did we know Frank Sinatra was a good singer until he sang onstage?\" Sherwood asks.","That April 7, Sherwood started Kane against Sunderland. Kane scored. Sherwood started him in Tottenham's next game, at West Bromwich Albion. Kane scored. Sherwood started him against Fulham. Kane scored again. Kane started every game for the rest of the season.","Sherwood had found a Sinatra.","Kane isn't content to merely conquer soccer. \"If you play in the Premier League and the World Cup and then in the NFL, would you then be considered one of the greatest sportsmen ever?\" he said. Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images","Out the train window, which is how you get the best view, it looks like a flying saucer. On the street it looms, gloriously but incongruously, over a neighborhood of ramshackle storefronts selling jerk chicken and calling cards to Africa. In early April, Tottenham's new stadium will finally be ready for a football match.","The designs for the new facility, advertised as the best in the world, were made in 2008. Since construction began in 2015, the projected opening date has been pushed back countless times, including almost on a match-by-match basis throughout the 2018-19 season. The delays left Tottenham lingering in their temporary home at Wembley, suitcases packed but nowhere to go. During that time, too, the cost -- bloated by overtime fees, nearly a season's worth of additional Wembley rentals and problems with the safety system -- has more than doubled, from roughly $600 million to more than $1.2 billion.","The idea of building a new stadium, which includes both an artificial surface for NFL games and a grass pitch, is meant to lift Spurs into the revenue-generating class of Arsenal, Chelsea and the Manchester clubs. Eventually a massive naming rights deal will be signed that may even approach the $500 million over 20 years that Levy is said to be seeking. For now, though, the stadium has become a very expensive, glass-and silver paneled millstone around his neck. The annual service on $800 million in loans will make splash spending nearly impossible this year, and perhaps years to come. Skeptics are quick to note that you can hardly spend less than literally nothing, but this isn't about adding quality as much as keeping the quality you have. \"Arsenal suffered after they moved to their stadium,\" Pochettino says. \"They struggled to keep their best players. I hope that will not happen here.\"","What Pochettino has accomplished in five years at Tottenham, blending tactical insights, motivational mastery and a dollop of magic, has been remarkable. But the standings function by wins, losses and draws, not expectations exceeded. The unavoidable question is whether the third-best team in England can keep the best striker in the world. History is skeptical. The reigning Ballon d'Or winner, Luka Modric, played at Tottenham until 2012, when he was lured away by Real Madrid. A year later, Gareth Bale left for the same team in what was at the time the most lucrative football transfer in history. \"That chance to wear that white shirt of Real Madrid, quadruple your wage bill, win Champions League titles,\" says Sherwood. \"It's hard to turn down.\"","Kane's rise has coincided with that of Pochettino, the mercurial manager who has elevated Tottenham since his arrival in 2014. \"We both want the same things,\" said Kane. \"We both want to push and push and push, and work and work.\" OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images","Now Madrid is after Kane, by all accounts. The forces of battle are lining up predictably. On one side is loyalty to his lifelong club, and the immeasurable comfort of staying near home and his extended family. On the other is a sizable raise from his $13 million annual salary, coupled with the opportunity to play for a club successful enough to satisfy Kane's ambition to keep getting better even when he's already best. Real Madrid is suffering through its worst season in a generation, but an early Champions League exit is likely to push the team that has won the competition four times in the last five years to spend freely to return to a level of prominence that its supporters expect. \"It would be a wrench for him to leave Tottenham and go somewhere else,\" Sherwood acknowledges. \"He certainly wouldn't go anywhere else in the Premier League. If he goes anywhere, it would be Real Madrid. He's a Real Madrid kind of player.\"","Kane refuses to look down the road. \"It's something you assess along the way,\" he says. Still, it's hard to imagine someone who identifies with a six-time Super Bowl champion remaining satisfied with a team that merely outperforms its wage bill. \"A lot of people look at it and say this is maybe the best team we've had, maybe the best team we'll ever have, and the best manager, but it's important that we have something to show for it,\" he acknowledges. \"It's not just, when we look back in 10 years, we had a great team. It's, 'Look what they did. Look what they won.' The challenge for us is, can we keep going up and up and up? It's going to be difficult in the next couple of years with the stadium and the finances.\"","When Pochettino arrived in the summer of 2014, he inherited two expensive strikers, Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor. It didn't take long for him to realize that Kane would be his centerpiece. \"He was improving and growing,\" Pochettino says. \"We couldn't stop him. The moment that we started to work with him, he was so open to learn and improve. We just had to give him the space to show his quality and start to play, and he started to score goals and be fantastic.\"","Since then, their fortunes have been intertwined. \"The journey at Spurs really started for me and him at the same time,\" Kane says. The presence of Kane, who signed a six-year contract extension last year, has fortified Pochettino against the advances of other clubs-including Real Madrid. Pochettino has also fielded at least preliminary inquiries from other teams, and linked with jobs from Manchester to, yes, Madrid. Seeing him commit to Spurs through 2023 helps Kane keep the faith. \"We both want the same things,\" Kane says. \"We both want to push and push and push, and work and work.\" But then he feels compelled to add, \"We'll just have to see what happens this season, and go from there.\"","It's not just Tottenham that gets the best of Kane. He has 21 goals in 36 appearances for England and is at the core of the Three Lions' resurgence under Gareth Southgate. Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images","There's no dispute that Kane is known best for scoring goals. He had six of them in last summer's World Cup, enough to win the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer. Under Pochettino, he has scored 143 goals in the Premier League and Europe, more than a third of the team's total despite the lack of any other consistent threat to relieve marking pressure.","Not satisfied with being just a finisher, Kane has made himself into a No. 9 who plays like a No. 10, which happens to be his jersey number, or occasionally even a central midfielder. For someone with Kane's build and skill set, it's an impressive achievement. \"People have this kind of old-fashioned view of an English No. 9 to be big and strong, and hold the ball up and flick it on, and they can finish as well,\" Kane says. \"I can do that, but that's not my game. My game is a mixture of things. Dropping deep, creating space, passing. When games are going not that well, you can do other things to help your team other than just shooting.\"","These days, Spurs players will confirm, Kane is the most accomplished passer on the team. \"Watch him when he drops a little deeper into midfield and holds off some stronger defenders,\" says Craig Burley, the former Chelsea and Derby County player and Scottish international who now commentates for ESPN. \"Then he sprays a 40- or 50-yard pass across the field, and it's about 10 feet above the ground at all times and usually right on the spot.\"","\"He has the quality and the brains to operate in different areas,\" adds Jan Vertonghen, who has seen Kane evolve since joining Spurs in 2012. Still, Vertonghen prefers to see him playing in the box and not just because that's where the goals come from. If Kane's there, it means the ball is getting through. It's only when it isn't that he goes foraging for it.","Kane's delight in confounding expectations may take him even further afield. When he's done with this kind of football, he doesn't see why he can't try the other kind, maybe after a year or two in MLS as a segue. He enjoys America, and his obsession with Brady has led to a fascination with all things NFL. Out of the Tottenham lineup with a bad ankle, he flew to Atlanta to watch the Patriots win the Super Bowl. Then Brady, who has been corresponding with Kane on social media, invited him to the team party.  \"We'd kind of become friends but had never met,\" Kane says. \"It was a bit strange. I hadn't been a fan of any team since I was young and supporting Tottenham.\"","Kane is convinced that his knack for placing a ball just where he wants to can be extrapolated to place-kicking, as it was in the late 1990s for former Spurs forward Clive Allen in NFL Europe. \"That's real,\" he insists. \"Something that in 10 or 12 years I definitely want to try.\"  It wouldn't be for the fame, and the contract of an NFL kicker would pay him a fraction of what he'd get scoring goals a few more years in Dubai or China. \"It goes back to that drive to be the best,\" he says. \"Even if I download a game on my phone, can I be the best in the world?\" The incentive isn't just to compete against other kickers, he reveals, but everyone who ever laced up a pair of athletic shoes. \"If you play in the Premier League and the World Cup and you then play in the NFL,\" he wonders, \"would you then be considered one of the greatest sportsmen ever?\"","He's serious, but don't go buying one of the Kane NFL jerseys on sale at the new Spurs team shop just yet. Pochettino likes to tell his players that football takes you where it wants to. It's his way of reminding them not to make grand plans, to live in the moment, because life will surprise them. \"Football is so dynamic,\" he says. Maybe Spurs will win the Champions League this year (it's far from inconceivable, especially with Real Madrid out) and become the next Manchester City, and Kane will stay forever and become iconic, the club's Raul, its Beckenbauer, its Iniesta. Or maybe they flame out in the quarterfinals, fall behind Arsenal and Chelsea and out of the top four, and fade back into midtable, West Ham with a better stadium. Would Pochettino turn down Real Madrid at that point? Would Kane?","\"You can't fight against your destiny,\" Pochettino says, answering a question about Kane's future. What that means, he has no idea. But he wants to make the point that it isn't a question of logic or even always free will, so predictions are foolish. He stops for a moment to consult with Jesus Perez, his assistant manager, to get the translation of an Argentine proverb just right. Finally, he has it. \"You can try,\" he says. \"But you can't block out the sun with your hands.\"","Welcome to the 2018 FC 100","Sam Borden: In search of Emiliano Sala","Wright Thompson: The greatest game never played","Tragedy in the Vulture's nest: The deadly fire at Flamengo","More Stories"],"targetCaptions":[]}

We’re creating a new normal in which the Conservatives are consistently ahead of the Liberal Party,” said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs.","“People in Ottawa can say what they want about the significance of the scandal — ‘there’s no sex, there’s no money, what is this all about?’","“But Canadians are sitting back and saying this has really caused them to reconsider supporting a combination of this prime minister and this Liberal government.”","The province-by-province breakdown makes for worrying reading for the Liberals.","In seat-rich Ontario, the Conservatives (40 per cent) have opened up a 12-point lead over the Liberals, who are tied with the NDP at 28 per cent.","The Tories also enjoy a double-digit lead in British Columbia, where the Liberals and NDP are in a scrap for second place.","Alberta looks to be a foregone conclusion, with the Conservatives (63 per cent) light-years ahead of the Liberals (17 per cent) and NDP (15 per cent).","“When you take a look at where the Conservatives are leading, they’re now leading everywhere you need to lead,” Bricker said. “They really don’t need anything else to beat the Liberals.”","WATCH: Prime Minister in campaign mode in B.C.","Indeed, the only province in which the Liberals are in pole position is Quebec, where they have the support of 38 per cent of respondents.","However, the Conservatives (25 per cent) and Bloc Quebecois (23 per cent) appear to have enough strength to prevent the Liberals from truly taking advantage of their Quebec share as they did in 2015.","The NDP, with only 12 per cent of the vote support, is poised to lose most if not all of its seats in Quebec. But it’s not the Liberals who stand to gain from Quebecers deserting the NDP, Bricker said.","“These are not people who are Liberal-NDP switchers. These are probably Bloc Quebecois voters who couldn’t vote Bloc last time because of all the problems they were having, combined with people who voted for the Coalition Avenir Quebec,” Bricker said.","WATCH: NDP faces steep ‘incumbency disadvantage’","Compounding the Liberals’ misery is the fact that their leader is now bleeding support among some of the core constituencies that helped sweep him to power in 2015.","Forty per cent of women now say they would vote Conservative, compared to just 28 per cent for the Liberals (the Tories enjoy a similar lead among men).","Among younger voters aged 18 to 34, the Conservatives (34 per cent) hold a slight lead over the Liberals (31 per cent).","The only key subset among which the Liberals lead is the university-educated, with 44 per cent approval compared to 30 per cent for Conservatives.","“What’s happened is that the brand that Trudeau had — he had a strong appeal among young people, and there was a gender gap that worked in his favour — all seems to be gone,” Bricker said.","Indeed, Trudeau’s individual approval rating as prime minister now sits at 40 per cent, three points lower than that of Trump in the U.S.","“In spite of all the issues that they’ve had to deal with in the United States, the likelihood that the president of the United States will get re-elected is higher right now than the prime minister [of Canada] being re-elected,” Bricker said.","Trudeau’s 40 per cent rating is also lower than that of former prime minister Stephen Harper at this stage in 2015, with Harper having a 47 per cent rating in April 2015.","READ MORE: Almost half of Americans still believe Trump colluded with Russia, according to Reuters/Ipsos poll","Furthermore, any hopes that the Liberals might have had about the federal budget prompting a rebound in their fortunes appear to have dissipated, the poll suggests.","Asked how they felt about Budget 2019, 64 per cent of Canadians said they were indifferent, a figure that includes 67 per cent of Liberal supporters. Twenty-five per cent said the budget was bad, while 11 per cent said it was good.","“There are only a certain number of cards a government can play, and the single biggest one is the budget, particularly a pre-election budget,” Bricker said. “You’re hoping that you’re going to get noticed, you’re going to get on the radar, that this is going to contrast you with your opponents.","“The worst outcome you can have is that they hate the budget, and the second-worst is that they ignore it — and they ignored it.”","WATCH: Scheer calls Liberal spending plan ‘most expensive cover-up in history of cover-ups’","If the source of many of the Liberal Party’s woes is the SNC-Lavalin scandal, that’s also where they need to look for solutions to turn their situation around, Bricker said.","“The first thing Trudeau has to recognize is that what he’s doing now isn’t working,” he said. “If this is the strategy — to go on, day by day, fighting it out with his opponents in his own caucus and dealing with the media the way that he has — it’s not working.","“Every day, it’s getting a little bit worse.”","ANALYSIS: Biggest peril for Team Trudeau is that Liberals are at war with each other","Bricker said it’s high time Trudeau thinks about allowing former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott to speak out about the SNC-Lavalin affair.","“Even if they’ve got some bad things to say about the way things were handled, how much worse could the damage be than what [the Liberals] are already taking?” said Bricker.","“Every day that it goes on, it just confirms people’s worst fears… If there’s a really good story that the government has and it’s not going to be as damaging as what the two dissident former ministers are going to say, you’d better let them talk.","“This isn’t going away.”","WATCH: Ethics Committee rejects opposition call for new SNC-Lavalin probe","Despite the Conservatives’ strong current position, Bricker says Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer will eventually need to do more than simply put his feet up and watch the Liberal Party implode under the weight of SNC-Lavalin.","“At some point, people are going to turn to the question of, ‘OK, if not Justin Trudeau, what does his likely replacement look like?’ and Scheer’s going to have to be ready to be able to respond to both the hopes and the fears that Canadians would have about him,” Bricker said.","READ MORE: Scheer says Liberals used federal budget as a ‘political prop’","“The truth is that, at the moment, Canadians don’t really know anything about him.","“It’s going to be an interesting test when the lights turn on and the cameras turn his way, how he’s going to be able to respond.

Spacesuits","Nasa saw immediate outrage on Twitter when they announced the all-female spacewalk would be cancelled over a medium-sized spacesuit.","The agency clarified that astronaut Anne McClain had belatedly realised the medium size fitted her better than the large she had been using, and so, for safety reasons, she was pulled from the walk.","There are two medium-sized suits on the International Space Station, but only one had been properly configured for a spacewalk, and getting the spare up to standard would have taken hours.","Ms Criado Perez says it's still telling that the sizes available were medium, large, and extra-large only.","We’ve seen your tweets about spacesuit availability for Friday’s spacewalk. To clarify, we have more than 1 medium size spacesuit torso aboard, but to stay on schedule with @Space_Station upgrades, it’s safer & faster to change spacewalker assignments than reconfigure spacesuits. pic.twitter.com/tPisBHaF2p","End of Twitter post  by @NASA","Notably, Nasa had to nix their small sized suits in the 1990s due to budget cuts, NPR reported. That meant one-third of the women at the time were unable to fit into any spacesuits.","2. Military equipment","In 2016, the US military began to recruit women for combat roles in previously male-only units in the Army, Marine Corps and Navy SEALs - but much of the armour was still designed for men.","The Army added eight smaller sizes to accommodate women that year, but other gear like shoes and helmets were not fully addressed.","Democratic Congresswoman Niki Tsongas at the time called out the military's unresponsiveness to the needs of female service members, citing the \"alarming\" disadvantages for women, including being unable to properly fire a weapon, Military.com reported.","Several women told Buzzfeed News this year that during their service, they had been forced to adapt body armour to fit them, even if that meant removing protective side panels or putting pieces of foam under straps to reposition gear and ensure their organs were protected.","Last year, the Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Joseph Dunford said they would work on speeding up the process of getting armour fitted for women, but the rollout of new gear remains incomplete.","\"Women went through Iraq and Afghanistan - up to 2018 - in equipment designed for men,\" says Alex Elias, a scholar focusing on women in the military.","But even before these relatively new roles opened up, women in the military were forced to deal with dangerously improper attire. During World War Two, Ms Elias says, women were never expected to be in non-office roles, so the military failed to prepare uniforms for other jobs, like mechanics.","3. Car crash dummies","The US government did not adequately test the impact of a crash on a belt-restrained female dummy until 2012. Dummies for decades had been based on the average, 50th percentile male body.","According to a 2011 University of Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics study, that meant female drivers involved in crashes had a 47% greater chance of serious injury than their male counterparts, and a 71% higher chance of a moderate injury.","Ms Criado Perez notes that even now, this female dummy is often just a scaled down version of a male dummy, which does not provide accurate information about how a crash impacts a woman.","It's a similar story in the European Union.","\"In the EU, out of the five regulatory tests that there are, only one specifies that you must use that [female] dummy and it's only in the passenger seat.\"","She says it's clear the industry is aware they must address the issue of women - but \"they haven't done it in any sensible way that accounts for the fact that women are 50% of the population\".","4. Smartphones","From apps to the actual size, there are a number of design features that have made some women say smartphones have been designed with only men in mind.","Women's hands are, on average, around an inch smaller than men's - which can make the industry's ever-increasing screen sizes problematic to use.","Texting one-handed on a 4.7-inch (12cm) or bigger iPhone can be difficult to impossible for many women (and small-handed men).","\"Welcome to the big screens\" says Apple and women like me with small hands who need the most secure phone for safety reasons are stuck with something they can't hold and constantly risk dropping. Company that designs $5 billion headquarters without a childcare center for the win. pic.twitter.com/Owzy51RsrH","End of Twitter post  by @zeynep","Ms Criado Perez also pointed out that the health app and Siri were also unintentionally biased against women.","In 2016, Apple fixed a glitch that had Siri sending abortion seekers to adoption centres instead - five years after the issue was raised.","\"The comprehensive health app on the iPhone that didn't have a period tracker; the way Siri could find a Viagra supplier but not an abortion provider - that's what happens when you don't include women in the decision making process,\" Ms Criado Perez says.","\"It's not a conspiracy. I don't think for a moment the designers of Apple wanted to screw women over - I think they didn't know.\"","5. Sports attire","When US basketball superstar Stephen Curry designed a new line of shoes for kids last year, only boys sizes were offered.","A nine-year-old girl named Riley eventually wrote Mr Curry a letter asking why that was the case.","hey @stephencurry30 can u help? pic.twitter.com/3jwuEc776B","End of Twitter post  by @feministabulous","\"I know you support girl athletes because you have two daughters,\" she added. \"I hope you can work with Under Armor to change this because girls want to rock the Curry 5's too.\"","Mr Curry thanked her and explained that the smaller sizes had all been labelled as \"boys\" on the website.","Appreciate you helping us get better Riley! We got you. #MoreToCome pic.twitter.com/UBoTklvwhg","End of Twitter post  by @StephenCurry30","As of March 2019, boys still have more apparel options in the Under Armor Curry line, but most of the shoes are available for both genders.","6. Science gear","Biologist Jessica Mounts, executive director of the Kansas Alliance for Wetlands and Streams, told the BBC's Chris Bell that most of the equipment she has used was designed for men.","\"The problems caused aren't simply an annoyance - they all go back to personal safety,\" she says. \"Clothing that is too loose gets caught in moving equipment. Boots that are too big mean tripping and falling.\"","\"The alternatives that are 'designed for women' are frequently more expensive, have smaller pockets, are still ill-fitting.\"","Read her full story here.","7. Office space","These design flaws aren't just about something worn or handled - even environments can be biased towards men's preferences.","The formula for standard US office temperatures was developed in the 1960s, based on the metabolic rate of an average 40-year-old man weighing 154 pounds (70kg).","A 2015 study published in the journal Nature found that a female metabolic rate can be up to 35% lower than the male rate used in those calculations - which amounts to, on average, a five degree temperature preference difference.","Last year, Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon brought the issue to headlines ahead of a primary debate with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, when her team called his frigid temperature demands sexist.","Historian Shirley Wajda says: \"For all the corporate talk about teamwork, it's hard to feel part of a team when you are placed in an inhospitable physical environment.\"","She added that popular mesh office chairs exacerbate chilly conditions, while other seating fads like barstool-height chairs can be difficult for women in dresses or skirts to sit in comfortably.","Ms Wajda says when it comes to \"gender-biased design and equipment, historians haven't paid as much attention\", and trends towards standardisation for efficiency's sake lead to \"a 'one size fits all' sort of world\".","For Ms Criado Perez, since publishing her book, it's been gratifying to see an increased awareness of these issues - and, she adds, even the initial backlash about the Nasa spacesuits would never have happened a decade ago.","\"But it makes me so angry to think of all these women, living their lives, thinking there's something wrong with them - that they're too small or don't fit or whatever it is.\"","\"It's just that we haven't built anything for women.\"","Related Topics","Share this story        About sharing","More on this story","Top Stories","The opposition celebrates as the president's party loses the mayoralty of Ankara, and possibly Istanbul.","Features","Is our love of true crime problematic?","Brexit: EU nervous over UK's 11th-hour rethink","What would a comic president mean for Ukraine?","Four things to expect this week","Which countries will hold the power in 20 years' time?","Forgotten victims: Uncovering a Nazi massacre","BBC Capital: What motivates Gen Z and millennials?","'We're not cleaners' - sexism amid Sudan protests","Why tornado chasers are facing a storm over safety","Elsewhere on the BBC","Lyrics quiz","Have you been getting these songs wrong?","Feeling hot","What happens to your body in extreme heat?","BBC News Navigation","BBC News Services","Explore the BBC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

British Summer Time (BST) officially starts at 1am on Sunday 31 March, when the clocks go forward an hour to 2am.","With Brexit on the horizon, it remains to be seen whether changes to daylight savings time (DST) plans in continental Europe will have any effect on the British clocks in the future. This week MEPs voted to approve plans for European Union member states to abolish clock changes if they want.","DST has been mandatory in the EU since 2001, but the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has been championing the change, saying: “Clock-changing must stop. Member states should themselves decide whether their citizens live in summer or winter time.”","Countries are expected to choose to either remain permanently on summer or winter time, although Portugal and Greece are among those which have previously indicated they would rather retain the present system.","Post-Brexit this could become a thorny issue on the island of Ireland, with Dublin and Belfast going an hour out of synch with each other if the UK does not also abandon the concept of DST. The argument over a hard border on the island could make way for one about a time-zone border.","Spain is grappling with an even bigger time conundrum. In the 1940s, Gen Francisco Franco moved the whole country permanently an hour forward to Central European Time, keeping it in synch with Hitler’s Germany, rather than with neighbouring Portugal and the countries with which it shares longitude. It means that in the westernmost parts of Spain, sunrise can sometimes be as late as 8:56am. In 2016, the Spanish government began to look into solving the problem by permanently shifting the country back to Greenwich Mean Time.","It is more than a 100 years since the changing the clocks was first established in the UK under the Summer Time Act 1916. Despite the results of the EU survey suggesting that 82% of British respondents wanted to abolish DST, there does not seem to be any great political will to do so. Which means we can still all look forward to gaining an hour’s sleep when the clocks go back again on Sunday 27 October.","Most popular"],"targetCaptions":[]}

This is equivalent to 38 g or 9 teaspoons (tsp) of sugar.","Women","Women should use no more than 100 discretionary calories on sugar per day. This is around 25 g or 6 tsp of sugar.","Children","Children between the ages of 2 and 18 should consume no more than 25 g, or 6 tsp, of added sugar daily.","People with diabetes","Diabetes makes it difficult for the body to use glucose effectively. Since the body converts both naturally occurring and added sugars into glucose, people with diabetes must monitor their overall sugar intake.","But some foods affect blood glucose levels more than others, depending on their glycemic index (GI). Foods with a higher GI raise blood glucose more than foods with a lower GI.","A person with diabetes should regularly check their blood glucose level to ensure that it is within a safe range.

These foods also contain nutrients and may be sources of dietary fiber.","Added sugars are sugars or caloric sweeteners that manufacturers put in foods or drinks.","Added sugars can be natural or chemically manufactured. A type of sugar can be \"natural\" (i.e. unprocessed) without being \"naturally occurring.\"","Examples of natural sugars that manufacturers add to provide sweetness include honey, maple syrup, and coconut sugar.","Even fructose and lactose qualify as added sugars in many processed foods.","Examples of added sugars to look for on food labels include:","How to reduce sugar intake","People can reduce their intake of added sugar by:","Avoiding liquid sugar","Liquid sugar is in soft drinks and juices. The body digests it more quickly than the sugar in foods, and as a result, liquid sugar causes a greater spike in blood glucose levels.","If a person drinks sugary liquids on a regular basis, the repeated spikes in blood glucose can overload the pancreas and liver, causing health problems.","Sodas tend to contain the highest amounts of liquid sugar. A 12-ounce can of soda contains about 8 tsp of sugar, or 130 empty calories.","The following drinks may also contain liquid sugar:","Avoiding packaged foods","Research suggests that about 75 percent of packaged foods in supermarkets contain added sweeteners.","Examples of packaged foods that may contain added sugar include:","Swapping added sugars for natural alternatives","The following tips can help a person replace the added sugar in their diet with more healthful alternatives:","Trying sugar alternatives","Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) contain few or no calories.","Researchers have investigated whether replacing sugary foods and drinks with sugar-free options containing NNSs may help people consume fewer calories and maintain a healthy weight. They have reached differing conclusions.","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved the following NNSs for use in food:","Stevia is another type of NNS that the FDA consider to be \"generally recognized as safe.\" This means that experts agree that recommended amounts are safe to use.","It is best to limit the intake of NNSs and pay attention to overall calories consumed per day, as NNSs can lead to cravings and overeating.","Emerging research suggests that artificial sweeteners may have negative effects on metabolism, gut health, and cravings, but confirming these findings will require more research.","Summary","The average person in the U.S. consumes an excessive amount of added sugar, and experts have linked high sugar consumption to a range of diseases.","People can reduce their health risks by cutting down on the amount of added sugar in their diet.

The term, coined by Carol Glover in her book “Men, Women and Chainsaws” (1992), refers to a young woman, usually virginal, who is the last survivor of a violent psychopath and acts as the “investigating consciousness” of the film. She shrieked her way through the 1970s and 1980s in “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre”, “Halloween” and “A Nightmare on Elm Street”; “Scream” (1996), a slasher movie which mocked the worn tropes of the genre, more or less finished her off. So horror has shifted its emphasis onto another female figure: the mother.","Horror flicks, for all their sensationalist tendencies, have long interrogated expectations of motherhood. Pregnancy is shown not as a blessed state but as a dangerous, gory trauma. In “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968), gestation is a violation of sorts, a sickness that eats away at the body and a woman’s agency. In “The Fly” (1986), a science-fiction body horror, Ronnie (Geena Davis) has a nightmare about giving birth to a maggot; she seeks an abortion but is abducted. In “Alien” (1979) the surrealism of having another living being growing inside you is experienced by Kane (John Hurt). When the foreign creature bursts bloodily from his body, it kills him. (In later films Ripley, the sole survivor of the first doomed mission, has similarly nightmarish experiences of pregnancy and parenthood.)","Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.","Childbirth is frightening, and the resulting offspring often even more so. The demonic, terrifyingly uncanny children of “The Exorcist” (1973) and “The Omen” (1976) exploit maternal fears of finding a child alien and unlikable, and test the concept of unconditional love. Meanwhile the assumption that women ought to become sweet, caring homemakers has been undermined by casting them as villains. Norman Bates’s domineering mother is the inspiration for his crimes in “Psycho” (1960); Sissy Spacek’s “Carrie” (1976) is tormented by her fanatical parent. In “Friday the 13th” (1980) Jason’s mother is the murderous slasher.","In recent years film-makers have returned to these ideas and put several mothers at the centre of stories. A “Halloween” sequel (2018) showed Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis)—the original “final girl”—as an adult, twice-divorced and estranged from her daughter. “The Babadook” (2014), “mother!” (2017), “Hereditary” (2018), “A Quiet Place” (2018), “Bird Box” (2018), “The Hole in the Ground” (2019, pictured) and “Us” (2019) all featured female protagonists grappling with family issues. Some of these characters are isolated, either through divorce or widowhood. Many are fighting their own demons as well as the villains that wish them harm.","The characters are often ambivalent about their responsibilities and the expectations placed on them. In “The Babadook” (2014) Amelia (Essie Davis) is a widow whose grief makes caring for her troublesome son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) all the more difficult. The monster of the title comes from a magic pop-up book, but its true identity is a projection of Amelia’s desperation and anger. In “Hereditary”, Toni Collette’s Annie is a literal homemaker, an artist who specialises in making miniature dollhouses. She had a loveless relationship with her late mother, and plainly resents her own son and daughter. Both films include scenes in which the mother says the unsayable: they wish their children were dead, or had not been born. The sentiment has monstrous consequences.","Other films have cast women as formidable heroes. Evelyn (Emily Blunt), the survivalist mother in “A Quiet Place”, helps to protect her family against monsters that hunt using sound. She gives birth noiselessly and without help, and takes charge when her husband dies. In “Bird Box”, Malorie (Sandra Bullock) guides two children, blindfolded, through a post-apocalyptic landscape (some otherworldly force makes people see their worst fears, driving them to commit suicide). The women’s maternal instincts are helped by the fact that they are steely and quick-witted.","Horror is most unsettling when it invites audiences to imagine danger in safe places, particularly the home, and so mothers make ideal protagonists. At the same time, these figures allow film-makers to undermine assumptions that women are vulnerable (especially when pregnant), weak and fearful, as well as the idea that motherhood is always a rewarding experience. This makes for complex and nuanced characters. The “final girl” has grown up into the “final mother”.","Prospero","by J.B.","Brexit and ParliamentTheresa May loses again, again","Intimidating the prosecutorRomania appears to be so afraid of Laura Codruta Kovesi that it indicted her","Ecumenism in AmericaThe Trump era has exposed divisions among Catholics and evangelicals","Daily chartMPs’ Brexit votes reveal myriad divisions among the Tories","Join them.

And who's among the Fallen? #AvengeTheFallen posters reveal answers to questions we've asked for a year. ","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["News","Who Survived? And who's among the Fallen? #AvengeTheFallen posters reveal answers to questions we've asked for a year.","One month remains until audiences will learn how the Avengers take back their universe in Avengers: Endgame. And as the smart minds at Marvel Studios know how to capitalize on a moment like that, they released an overwhelming amount of character posters Tuesday tallying the living and the dead. Although we imagine showing the work of Thanos’s (Josh Brolin) grim calculus was not their primary goal, the release clearly lays out who among the sprawling Marvel family still breathes air going into Endgame. Let’s take a look at who disappeared, who faced the horror, and who might still be unaccounted for.","The Fallen: Posters Confirm Shuri Did Not Survive the Snap","With the posters featuring lost characters in black and white, Marvel introduces a new term for those lost moments after the Snap – the Fallen. It’s a handy term, if one often used in supernatural films and television shows to categorize those who went to war against Heaven. But within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it boils down a mouthful into one word.","The Fallen include headliners like Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), supporting characters like Bucky (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the entire Pym/Van Dyne family, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Additionally, all of the Guardians of the Galaxy except Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) were also lost in the Snap.","The Fallen also includes three people featured on the new character posters who fell prior to Thanos’s quick-fingered coup de grace: Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Gamora (Zoe Saldana). The latter’s death was always significant as Thanos threw her off a cliff to get the Soul Stone – and presumably she will haunt him on his garden planet. Loki’s death, however, felt far from final as he cheats death all the time. Maybe he will be the first of the Fallen (heh) to return. And Vision? Well, he is going to be part of that Disney+ limited series with Scarlet Witch, so his resurrection also seems assured.","The list of the Fallen has remained pretty consistent since last Spring, but the character posters finally confirmed Shuri (Letitia Wright) went into the dust with her brother. Many suspected this was the case when her photo appeared in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment in the first Endgame trailer, leading to months of speculation. But with the poster, her death is confirmed. We imagine fans will need some time to process this.","The Survivors: Valkyrie, Pepper Confirmed Survivors","By keeping the Fallen in black and white and the survivors in color, Marvel also confirmed a handful of characters whose status was unknown until Tuesday. Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Wong (Benedict Wong), Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) all survived the Snap. They join Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket, War Machine (Don Cheadle), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) as those facing a universe with such terrible losses and determining a way to undo Thanos’s ultimate act.","When we last saw Wong, he was headed back to the Sanctum Sanctorum to defend it should any members of the Black Order head there. Over the past year, we’ve joked that he made the smartest choice by high-tailing it out of the movie and it seems his decision proved to be a wise one. It remains to be seen how the Avengers may approach Wong or how his understanding of the mystic arts will aid them, but it’s safe to presume the survivors will tackle the Thanos problem from all angles – including ones they may have previously dismissed as so much hokum.","Valkyrie, meanwhile, adds another number to the powerhouse squad with Thor, Carol, and the Hulk (should he decide to come out of hiding). When we last saw her, she was with Thor aboard the Asgardian refugee ship. Since she managed to survive both Thanos’s attack on the vessel and the Snap, we’re going to assume she helped the few remaining Asgardians – there are a few left, right? – find shelter. If that mission is complete, it is likely she will join Thor in a search for a solution. Or, knowing her, she took it upon herself to figure out some way of revenging after a few stiff drinks.","Also, we imagine the already burgeoning corps of Valkyrie/Carol shippers are quaking at the possibility the two will share some screen time in Endgame.","Considering Favreau’s decision to leave the creative aspects of the Marvel Universe behind, it is always nice to see Happy survive where other support characters have literally bitten the dust. Then again, we knew his long-term survival was assured thanks to his appearance in the Spider-Man: Far From Home trailer. But since we’re assuming most of the Fallen will return during the events of Endgame, it was only a question of whether or not he was lost in the Snap. And while everyone assumed Pepper’s survival because of Tony’s message to her in both Endgame trailers, the poster is proof positive she is alive. You can bet she will pour as much of Stark Industries’ resources as she can muster into rebuilding the world and helping the Avengers.","Others Whose Fates Are Still Unknown","The posters also offer a reliable guess as to who among the Fallen we might see in Endgame – a Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) poster certainly suggests she will appear – but there are a few characters who are notable by their absence on posters and their still unknown status going into Endgame.","As we always thought it was possible for Luis (Michael Peña) to knock out Thanos with one punch, his status intrigues us the most. Although, he is just one member of the Ant-Man family we want clarification on. Did Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) survive? Considering online rumors insist an older, time-traveling Cassie will feature in Endgame, keeping her fate obscured may be part of Marvel’s plan. And what of Maggie (Judy Greer), Paxton (Bobby Cannavale), Kurt (David Dastmalchian), Dr. Foster (Laurence Fishburne), and Ava (Hannah John-Kamen)? Sure, they may not factor into Endgame beyond motivating Scott to make for the Avengers HQ, but clarity is always appreciated.","Others unaccounted for include General Ross (William Hurt), Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Peter’s classmates, Maria and Monica Rambeau (Lashana Lynch and Akira Akbar), and Howard the Duck.","Of course, it still remains to be seen how the survivors will avenge the Fallen. But will they remain Fallen by the time Endgame concludes? Or will there be new Fallen to mourn?","Like this?

In this alternate video, that scene occurs at 1:35. However, in the background, as the Avenger flees, we can now spot what appears to be a multi-armed monster being incinerated. If you saw Avengers: Infinity War, then you can see where the parallel is drawn, as the creature bears an uncanny resemblance to one of Thanos' insectoid minions.","RELATED: Avengers: Endgame Character Posters Honor the Living & the Fallen","It leaves us wondering, if this snippet is real, do more Outriders come to the present day, or did some remain after the Wakanda battle?

Until this scene plays out on the big screen, all we can do is speculate.","Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Avengers: Endgame stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau and Bradley Cooper, with Gwyneth Paltrow and Josh Brolin.

William Gray decided to see what Bautista would look like as the popular Batman villain Bane, and it certainly gave other fans something to think about. The design is pretty simple actually, utilizing the real Bautista's bulky frame and extensive ink to do most of the talking. The costume is also pretty simple, going with a black tank top but also wearing the Bane mask from the comics with some tweaks.","Those tweaks are pretty noticeable however, as the mask has cutouts around the eyes and mouth. In the books, the eyes are covered with glowing red lenses and the mouth typically has a full white mask covering it. The more muzzle-like mask became a favorite after Tom Hardy's portrayal in The Dark Knight Rises, though this design ditches both versions for something a bit more natural.","You can't have Bane without Venom of course, and you can see the tubes flowing from his back into his arms and head.

The roster of villains Gunn is reportedly using is quite the eclectic bunch, including villains like Polka-Dot and Ratcatcher, and having someone of Bane's caliber could be a great way to even it out with some mainstream power. Plus, having all that strength at your disposal probably wouldn't hurt either.","For now, we'll have to wait and see, but at least Gunn will be reteaming with Bautista on Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, which he was recently rehired for.","As for Bane, a new version of the villain was recently introduced on Gotham and is played by Shane West. This version seems to skew a bit more towards the Dark Knight Rises version from an aesthetic perspective, but like all Gotham characters features a unique flair all his own.","What do you think of this Bautista Bane?

Leave it to Marvel to introduce an infuriating wrinkle (and a savvy marketing ploy) one month ahead of Endgame: It turns out that Shuri, the beloved teen genius and technological architect of Wakanda, is among the dead.","Marvel released a plethora of character posters on Tuesday, exactly one month ahead of Endgame, that say “Avenge the fallen.” The characters appearing in color — Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, and Captain Marvel, among others — are characters alive post-snap. Shuri’s poster is in black and white (above), as are those featuring heroes like Spider-Man, Black Panther, Loki, and Groot — who were all vaporized or killed during Infinity War, seemingly confirming Shuri, too, was dusted.","Shuri also appears as one of the “missing” in the first Endgame trailer:","Prior to these posters, though, there was reason to believe Shuri wasn’t dead.","She wasn’t dusted onscreen, leading fans to believe she may have survived the snap. Further, Angela Bassett, who plays Shuri and Black Panther’s mother Ramonda, said in an interview with Screen Rant that both her character and Shuri are still alive following Infinity War.

These former investigators have worked on some of the biggest federal cases in recent history. Their experiences span three-plus decades, giving them a unique perspective on what might happen next.","Meet the crew of experts who answered your most pressing questions on Reddit:","We’ve reproduced some of the top Q&As below, edited slightly for brevity and clarity.","Advertisement","Question","Are you surprised?","— asked on Reddit by Shaokim","Samborn:","Yes, on two points.","I did not expect that Mueller would punt the question of obstruction to Congress, although I understand it makes sense if we assume that he was never going to make a decision to indict the president.","I think Attorney General Barr inserted a plot twist yesterday by superimposing his own judgment about obstruction in the absence of any special counsel regulation or authority calling for him to make that judgment.","Barrett:","With regard to Mueller’s bottom lines, not really. It makes sense that Mueller, who is an underling, not the boss of DOJ, would make the prosecution declination decision when he found insufficient evidence that Trump or any other U.S. person conspired with Russia to affect the 2016 election — declinations are what underling prosecutors do.","It also makes sense that on the other question – did the president endeavor to obstruct justice? — where the evidence and legal questions were closer and complicated, Mueller sent it all upstairs to his bosses Barr and Rosenstein for them to decide.","Myers Wood:","I am a little surprised that Mueller did not make a decision regarding a prosecution or declination decision regarding the potential obstruction of justice given that Mueller was likely in the best position to know the underlying facts and the relevant regulations. Mueller, of course, could have determined that such a decision was inappropriate given the guidance on whether a president could be indicted, but Barr’s summary does not make this clear.","Question","Could Trump and his family have indictments slapped on them from the many other investigations still going on?","— asked on Reddit by ExoticWear","Samuelsohn:","We got this question a bunch this weekend, so I'll take a stab at it here. Short answer, sure, it's possible Trump and his family could still face indictments down the line from the other investigations.","We know SDNY is looking into the Trump campaign finance spending out of the Michael Cohen case, as well as the inauguration committee. I'll point you to a story I wrote back in February (feels like years ago) quoting some former SDNY types saying they wouldn't rule out indictments against the president, especially given he is \"Individual 1\" in the Cohen case.","And while I'm touting all of my work from the last two years, here's a story I wrote that I think still very much applies that Trump's 2020 reelection won't just be about him winning a second term, it also could be a trigger point for him to face indictments he can't otherwise face while he's in office.","Lastly, don't forget as well the NY AG is also looking into the president's business enterprise","Question","When will the Mueller report be made public?","— asked on Reddit by TheGoldenHeaven","Samuelsohn:","Great question. If I knew the answer I would be rich.","Seriously, though, we are now in a waiting period – one that I’d say will take months, not weeks – while Attorney General William Barr and his aides go through the weeds of the report looking to remove classified and grand jury information that is not allowed to be made public.","In his letter yesterday, Barr said he’d be consulting with Mueller to help find all that information “as quickly as possible.” He also said he needs to be cognizant of other “ongoing matters” like open investigations, so that will slow things down a bit, since he doesn’t want to release a report that undermines potential prosecutions.","Barr reads the papers and knows there’s lots of clamor for this document. So he’ll be under pressure – especially from Democrats  – to get something more out.","Update","The day after our chat, a DOJ official said that Barr’s review would take “weeks not months.” So that could mean around mid-April is when we go through this whole routine again without maybe as much of the anticipation.","Myers Wood:","I generally agree with Darren, but think that the pressure from Congress to receive the full report is going to be substantial and Congress is not going to want to wait weeks or months.","One possibility is that DOJ could file a request with the Court to have all (or some) of the grand jury information in Mueller's report made available to the Congress so that the full report could be sent to Congress for their consideration. This is what happened for the Starr report. If the full report is sent to the Hill, Congress could release (or leak) the report very quickly.","Barrett:","I agree with Darren — this will take a lot of consulting, including with intelligence agencies, so it will take at least weeks, I think.","Question","Are you satisfied with Barr's summary? Or do you think it's suspect and that the full report needs to be released?","— asked on Reddit by YeahSureYnot","Barrett:","Middle ground. I don't think one can really assess Barr's summary without seeing Mueller's report. But I don't think there is a basis to suspect Barr or Mueller of anything nefarious — they are people of integrity.","Samborn:","I basically agree with John, although I believe it's critical to see Mueller's report.","I also think that Barr should be more transparent about why he decided to provide his and others’ assessment of the obstruction evidence and what his reasons were for doing so. It's not clear that Mueller invited Barr's evaluation of the evidence or if he intended for Congress to grapple with the issue.","Absent greater explanation from Barr, critics could claim that the president found a loyal protector to be his attorney general, undermining confidence in the process.","Question","To what extent does the fact that Trump was not interviewed by Mueller and his team impact the credibility of the investigation, particularly the obstruction of justice conclusions?","— asked on Reddit by Lanancer","Myers Wood:","Given what we know now, it is hard to consider the obstruction investigation complete without Trump’s testimony. However, Trump’s written answers, combined with his considerable public statements, maybe compelling and provide context for why these aggressive prosecutors did not push harder to interview Trump.","Samborn:","I agree but also think that Mueller simply made a strategic decision at some point not to subpoena the president and engage in a year or more of litigation that not only would have delayed completing his mission, but would risk an adverse ruling in the Supreme Court with consequences lasting well beyond the Trump presidency.","Question","How do you feel the course of Russiagate has compared to Watergate in terms of scope, impact and its indelible impact on defining the respective presidency?","— asked on Reddit by Maelstrom218","Barrett:","As a criminal and a government oversight investigation, this isn't Watergate yet.","In 1973, the Senate's Ervin Committee was very actively investigating, including by taking lots of private testimony and then by holding extensive, continuing public hearings, and that was producing many serious allegations of presidential and senior White House official criminality. It produced information on the existence of White House tapes, and that led to the special prosecutor issuing subpoenas and winning litigation to get some of the tapes.","Here, the House is not yet doing that kind of investigation, at least not visibly. It's also not clear that there is that kind of evidence, from insiders, pertaining directly to the president being a criminal.","Of course, seeing Mueller's report on evidence of the president's possible obstructions of justice could add a lot to the current public picture.","Question","What is the point of an independent special counsel if the decision whether to prosecute is made by the attorney general? Isn't the entire point of a special counsel to avoid the specter of a politically motivated cover-up?","— asked on Reddit by Antigonus1i","Samborn:","Unfortunately, and at least for now, I think the attorney general's insertion of his judgment that there was no obstruction of justice does, in fact, undermine the special counsel apparatus.","It is critical that politics not cross the threshold of DOJ, and the special counsel regulations exist to ensure that politics are not infused into investigations and prosecutions that affect the executive branch and have political overtones and repercussions.","Unless or until Barr explains why he took it upon himself to declare no obstruction, public confidence in an independent process could be legitimately questioned.","Barrett:","Mueller is not an \"independent\" special counsel — he is a special counsel within the Department of Justice, appointed by the attorney general (in this case, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein in 2017) and subject to his supervision, and to supervision by Attorney General William Barr's, following his appointment.","Yes, they all work for the president, and that relationship creates the appearance of possible conflict of interest when a special counsel/AG decides that the president is not a criminal.","The U.S. Congress chose to accept this risk in 1999, when it permitted the Independent Counsel law, which provided for court-appointed prosecutors (such as my former boss Lawrence Walsh, and Julie's former boss Ken Starr), to expire. In taking that risk, Congress was avoiding the risk that a court-appointed independent counsel would turn out to be in fact a less-sound decision maker than would an attorney general, whatever his or her possible conflicts of interest. Even assuming everyone's honesty and talent, no approach will be perfect or satisfying to all in every situation.","Question","Mr. Barrett: What are your views on Barr's credibility in light of his role in the pardons after the Iran-Contra affair? What was the mood of Lawrence Walsh's team after President Bush issued those pardons?","— asked on Reddit by Invertedshamrock","Barrett:","Barr has explained, in an oral history interview that he gave after his first stint as AG, that he was very involved in advising President Bush 41 to issue Iran-Contra pardons on Dec. 24, 1992.","As we (Walsh's office) were two weeks from starting a trial (Weinberger’s) and had another one (Clarridge’s) coming in a few months, it was disappointing. Neither Barr nor the White House consulted with Walsh's office about possible pardons, so they thought what they thought on their own.","I think that they proceeded from misimpressions and it was not good decision-making. But it was, assuming nothing corrupt, within the president's constitutional powers — independent counsel Lawrence Walsh criticized the pardons but did not contest their legality.","I have no reason to doubt Barr’s integrity. But we can't assess the caliber of his summary of Mueller's report or the soundness of his (Barr's) decision that the evidence that President Trump obstructed justice is insufficient without seeing Mueller's report.","Question","Why do you think Mueller left it up to the AG as to whether or not any further indictments were made?","— asked on Reddit by Kayku25","Myers Wood:","A repeated criticism of other special counsels and independent counsels is that they dragged on too long and wandered into unrelated areas. \nBy closing the report and handing many significant investigations off to other prosecutors, Mueller signaled that he answered the two core questions he was asked, and appropriately referred side prosecutions elsewhere.","Question","What was the biggest challenge your team has had to face in the last few months in related to this investigation?","— asked on Reddit by Lt_Toodles","Samuelsohn:","Sleep. Eating healthy. Getting exercise. Thank god for my wife and cats, too, who played a big role in keeping me sane. Seriously, though, this has been a journey like no other covering this over the last two-plus years. Actually, for me personally, it started around the summer of 2016 when one of my editors assigned me to what we called at the time the \"shenanigans\" beat cause we didn't really know what it was that was happening — we just knew something weird was happening.","There were lots of difficult aspects to covering this whole thing, starting with the sheer cloak-and-dagger aspect of something that isn't really supposed to be taking place in public. I've had a lot of beats over the years, but not in the national security/intelligence/law enforcement world before 2016, so that was a challenge. Also just keeping tabs on everything that has happened -- and trying to stay on top of it all in a news environment that is very different than the one I got started in back in the 1990s (clunky computers, beepers, pay phones).","At POLITICO, we aren't anywhere near as big as the other giant media outlets like NYT and WaPo and AP and all the networks. So, we really tried to pick our punches and right elevated stories that helped connect the dots.","Speaking of dots, one more thing I'd tout that helped me keep everything in order was this award-winning graphic we constructed at the start of 2018 that put all the different people pulled into the Russia saga into one graphic. Enjoy!","Question","Who do you want to play you in the upcoming movie/HBO series?","— asked on Reddit by newpua_bie","Samuelsohn:","Christian Slater or Jason Bateman.

So it was his first time with Adam and working with Adam.","“Him going down in training camp the following year (2017) and then last season up and down so ... I don’t think, because after that 10-6 year with Adam you thought now it’s going to turn and it’s going to be what people hoped it would be as far as being a top 10 pick in the draft. The expectations are always, when you’re picked that high, through the roof.","Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month","Get full access to Miami Herald content across all your devices.","#ReadLocal","“And I think ... No, I don’t think it was a mistake.”","And now it’s time for a little concern. Because whatever you think of Tannehill -- good, bad or indifferent -- it is obvious he is history in the rear view mirror. So litigating his positives and negatives is folly.","But the topic is important here because Grier was part of the decision-making process on Tannehill the past three years. And now he’s leading the Dolphins expedition across the dangerous draft minefield the next couple of years to find a new quarterback.","And by his own admission, finding a franchise quarterback is the unquestioned, top priority of that mission.","But how can we have high confidence the looming search for a quarterback won’t be plagued by mistakes when the man leading that search doesn’t think the Tannehill years were a mistake? And let’s be clear, they were a mistake.","Everyone knows this.","I hope Grier, as a big proponent of Nick Saban, recognizes this is a problem. Because one of Saban’s favorite credos is that, “The best predictor of future behavior is past performance.”","And the Dolphins’ past with Tannehill was, without doubt, lacking foresight and vision. And if Grier cannot readily see this, that is not good.","A front office with vision might have worried about Tannehill in the spring of 2017 after the quarterback chose to not have surgery to repair a torn ACL and his backup Matt Moore was by the team’s own admission not capable of filling the void if one came up. Yet the Dolphins, dealing with uncertainty with two quarterbacks, did nothing in the 2017 draft to find a suitable quarterback addition of note.","“I think the one thing we could have all done, and me pushing too, was drafting someone behind him to come through,” Grier admitted. “So looking back, maybe we could have, but we had other needs so, you know, it was kind of a different mindset in the way we were doing things.","“There are some players there that we liked a lot and what we were looking for. But we also weren’t willing to mortgage the future at that time, in terms of working with Adam and going through the process. Patrick Mahomes? We liked Patrick Mahomes. I would say we probably didn’t spend a ton of time with him. But we met with him briefly, spent some time. Our guys who went on school visits liked him. Very talented player. As far as the other quarterbacks, they were all talented players but at that time, we weren’t willing to give up a couple first-round picks to move up at that point.”","Fine, so let’s excuse the Dolphins for not seeing the whole playing field after 2016 and missing on both Mahomes and DeShaun Watson in the ‘17 draft. I can understand it. But after a 2017 season in which Tannehill again blew out his knee, there was again no grand urgency to draft a quarterback in 2018...","...While the Jets traded up to draft a quarterback in the first round.","...While the Bills, picking behind the Dolphins in the first round, vaulted over Miami to draft a quarterback in the first round.","That was the tipping point. That was the critical hour for the Dolphins to replace Tannehill and failing to do so was a mistake that ultimately cost Adam Gase and Mike Tannenbaum their jobs.","So that wasn’t a mistake?","After a 2018 season in which Tannehill was clearly inconsistent and obviously not the right guy, the Dolphins new coaching staff did a two-week study on Tannehill. Grier did not tell them what he thought of Tannehill until the study was complete. And then the decision to move on from Tannehill was made.","“It was an organizational one,” Grier said. “I’m not going to say who this way or that way. But all of us we talked through it and at the end of the day we all thought that was the right move for the Dolphins going forward.”","This frustrates me because I want the Dolphins to succeed. I really do. I want to believe they will.","But for that to happen the decision-making that seems obvious to fans in the stands should always be old news at Dolphins headquarters. The Dolphins should know more about football than you and me. And on this Tannehill issue, the opposite seems true.","Amateur general managers and arm-chair coaches in the stands knew Tannehill was not it before the professional team did.","Grier on Monday said the quarterback position is one “you can never be satisfied in until you have the guy you really feel can give you a chance to win a championship.”","Did he feel Tannehill could win a championship after 2017? Really?","The chase will soon begin for Miami’s next franchise quarterback -- someone who might actually lead the team to some postseason success. And Grier is open to the process he will lead.","“I would say that all options are on the table for us,” he said. “Like I said, it always has to be the right guy, in terms of personality, leadership skills, what you’re asking him to do in terms of, is he going to fit with [offensive coordinator] Chad [O’Shea] and [head coach} Brian [Flores] believe in? So again, it’s going to be a lot of time here in the spring, getting to know a lot of these kids to determine if that’s who Chad and Brian and myself all believe is the right guy to lead us into the future.”","And might that mean drafting someone this year and next year?","“Yes,” Grier said.","I’m all for that. Draft one until you get it right.","But, that assumes, the Dolphins will be able to identify when they’ve made a mistake.","Related stories from  Miami Herald","miami-dolphins","How concerned are the Dolphins about the long-term health of Xavien Howard’s knees?","miami-dolphins","Robert Quinn trade update: Dolphins can keep him on their roster — ‘if we have to’","miami-dolphins","No tanks!

Roland Guelle, CTO of Berlin & Cologne-based Sevenval Technologies, presents seven trends that are important today and in the future.","“Everything goes front end.” This was Roland Guelle’s conclusion when asked about the front end development trends of 2018 in the Sevenval company blog about a year ago.","One year later, we asked him again and today, Roland Guelle presents seven tangible front-end development trends that will pick up speed in 2019:","Front End Leaves 2D","The front end is the interface between people and the digital world. Traditionally, we operate via mouse and keyboard on a desktop computer, today more frequently, via touchscreen on mobile devices. Traditionally, we work with “fat-clients” – i.e. software that runs completely on the user’s device – whereas today we often work with web applications. The front end is therefore increasingly leaving the traditional “two-dimensional space” and is operated via voice assistants, gesture control, applications for augmented as well as virtual reality and new 3D interfaces. This trend will continue in 2019 and could also be seen in last year’s Christmas trend: After millions of newly bought Alexa assistants were started around the world on Christmas day, Amazon ended up struggling with serious server issues and outages because of the millions of new Alexa assistants.","Data Driven Product Management","There are also new possibilities for data-driven product management. In 2019, work with MVPs, agile methodologies and big data will strongly influence the way products are designed and developed. More than ever before, decision making will be based on data, rather than gut feeling. This will help to develop new services and products in a lean and focused way.","Machine Learning For UX Optimization","Increasinly, machine learning-based approaches will be used to better understand how applications are actually utilized in order to optimize the user experience. Instead of using classic A/B testing to examine individual elements, such as menus, self-learning systems will be able to automatically adapt. The digital behavior of the individual user will become the most important foundation for designing apps according to these requirements. As a result, a navigation service can show the user the best route to the office immediately after the app has been launched – if the app has learned on which days, at what time and by which means of transport the user is heading for which locations. These are usability optimizations providing users with real added value.","Blockchain For Serious Applications","Nowadays when you hear the word ‘blockchain,’ most automatically think of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is probably the best-known application for blockchain technology but 2018 was a tough year for it: at the beginning of the year, one Bitcoin was worth over 10,000 euros. At the end of the year, the price was a little over 3,000 euros. But blockchain is primarily a decentralized database system and can be used for much more than just currencies. In 2019, private blockchains will also become more widespread and DLT will play an important role. After the hype for use cases in supply chain management and the Internet of Things, the technology will be used to generate real added value.","Web As Ubiquitous Application Framework","“Apps are dead” – said Sevenval CEO Jan Webering ten years ago. He was right. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), WebVR, nodeJS, React Native and other new technologies make the Web the “Ubiquitous Application Framework”: fit for all devices, all environments, and all application scenarios. This is very helpful for the providers of digital services, as they do not have to develop and maintain multiple tracks of native code for various devices. This trend will continue to accelerate in 2019.","Debugging In Production","The rule for a long time was: high test coverage, staging and then a “clean production.” Directly debugging in production systems? That was frowned upon. In times of microservices and distributed systems, the test coverage of each individual application remains very important. Nevertheless, the independence of the service landscape comes at the price of a higher complexity of the overall system. It will be increasingly difficult to recognize problems that exist in the overall system, but cannot be linked to a single service. The detailed monitoring of the core KPIs and the possibility of debugging in the production system without endangering stability and security are important building blocks for good development results in 2019.","Web Security In The Client","Can “security” be a trend? Yes, because 2019 is the year in which conventional browsers will take giant steps towards an “app environment.” Google has been leading the way with ChromeOS for a long time: The entire operating system is, first of all, a browser that brings web applications to the device. And this gives way to entirely new attack vectors, where the focus is no longer on individual servers or the corporate infrastructure, but primarily on users themselves. This trend will inevitably lead to a rethinking of security on client side.","And Even More Trends …","Check your SEO with Ryte for FREE","Start now!","Published on 03/26/2019 by Roland Guelle.","Roland Guelle","As CTO of Sevenval Technologies GmbH, founded in 1999, Roland Guelle is responsible for research and development.

With all of that in mind, Zack Snyder would like everyone to make their peace with the fact that the DCEU’s Batman has killed people, and nothing short of a universe-altering turn of events is going change that.","While answering audience questions about Watchmen during a recent event (that was filmed and posted to Reddit), Snyder described how fans still come up to him with gripes about the dark tone of his DC superhero movies, and the fact that both Batman and Superman have killed people. While Snyder understands where people’s objections come from, he added that he really wishes everyone would “wake the fuck up” and move on already:","Once you’ve lost your virginity to this fucking movie and then you come and say to me something about like ‘my superhero wouldn’t do that.’ I’m like ‘Are you serious?’ I’m like down the fucking road on that.","It’s a cool point of view to be like ‘my heroes are still innocent. My heroes didn’t fucking lie to America. My heroes didn’t embezzle money from their corporations. My heroes didn’t commit any atrocities.’ That’s cool. But you’re living in a fucking dream world.","Advertisement","Regardless of how you feel about Snyder’s films, the director has a point, given that, on the whole, studios tend to skew more “realistic” with their live-action adaptations of comic books. That means that certain characters like Batman who’ve always been rather brutal fighters might end up killing people depending on how a film or show plays out. Even if there isn’t something as jarring as seeing Batman let a bunch of people get hit by a car, the chaos and destruction that’s featured in these movies results in hundreds if not thousands of people (human or otherwise) dying, and so the point is rather moot.","Sure, Batman doesn’t kill in the comics, and that’s all very nice—but nitpicking about him killing in the films is literally one of the least interesting things to waste your time doing.","[h/t CBR]","For more, make sure you’re following us on our new Instagram @io9dotcom.","Advertisement","Share This Story","More Zack Snyder Stories","Zack Snyder's Next Movie Will Be an 'Epic and Crazy' Zombie Heist for Netflix [Updated]","For better or worse, Man Of Steel is the exact Superman movie Zack Snyder wanted to make","Directors' Cuts Won't Save You","People are Asking AT&T Customer Service to Release the Snyder Cut of Justice League","This Is the Picture That Proved Henry Cavill Could Be Superman","Apparently the Zack Snyder Justice League Cut Fans Have Been Petitioning for Doesn't Exist","About the author","io9 staff writer.

Now that Trump won't acknowledge basic things like climate change, it's time other countries had a say","I was nine years old when I first seriously pondered the result of a US presidential election. It was 2000 and my father suggested we bet on who would win the 2000 vote – George W Bush or Al Gore. In the kitchen of our apartment in the Paris suburbs, I bet a piece of gum that it would be Gore. Two months later, the Supreme Court decided otherwise, and I didn’t realise until many years later how close I had come to being right.","Perhaps that’s when it originated: the idea that maybe other countries shouldn’t just be left wringing their hands every four years and waiting to see who US citizens had chosen to appoint as (to speak like a White House staffer on Scandal) the leader of the Free World.","And perhaps that seed of an idea continued to gestate in 2004, when we waited to find out whether John Kerry would deprive George W Bush of a second term; then in 2008, when T-shirts bearing Barack Obama’s red and blue “Hope” poster started cropping up on the streets of the French capital; and again in 2012, when we learned the names of his Republican challengers.","We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.","From\n    15p\n    €0.18\n    $0.18\n    USD 0.27\n    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.","Then, of course, came November 2016, by which time I had moved from my native France to the US. I came home from work at approximately four the morning after the election and spent an hour or two on the phone with my mother (it was mid-morning in Paris) talking about Donald Trump’s ascent to power and what it meant for America as well as for the world.","One election after the next, we have seen how much the results of the US presidential vote impact not just the 50 states, but the rest of the planet too. And if the future of foreign countries is shaped to a significant extent by what goes on on US Election Day, shouldn’t they get a say in who gets to lead the most powerful nation in the world for the next four years?","In other words: shouldn’t foreign countries have a right to vote in the US presidential election?","I know, I know. The idea sounds so absurd, so outrageous that it’s hard to know where to begin your rebuttal. I have floated it around, timidly, in bars and at various dinner parties over the years, and let me tell you – it’s hard to get people to agree with me. And I get it: it’s never been done. I will probably never be done. But last week, a terrorist killed 50 people in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The alleged gunman, who had referred to himself as a white nationalist, viewed Donald Trump as “a symbol of renewed white identity”. So, yes, I think it’s high time to acknowledge the fact that what happens in the US has immense, tangible consequences on the rest of the world, and I am tired of crossing my fingers hoping that American voters will do the right thing.","I remember the Iraq war debate, and how George W Bush expressed his disappointment at my country and others for deciding not to align with US forces – while insisting that he was “not mad” we had decided to opt out of the invasion. I remember our collective bewilderment at the term “freedom fries”, and I remember lacking clarity on some of the details, on account of being 11 years old at the time. But the feeling that the US, more than any other nation, shapes our collective future has only grown clearer and stronger since.","Perhaps it helps to imagine America as the pot in which tomorrow’s ideas are brewed, for better or worse. Perhaps it helps, too, to look at the more tangible signs of how US politics contribute to shaping all of our lives. The most convincing example may be global warming, and Donald Trump’s overt skepticism when it comes to climate change. In January this year, the president of the world’s most powerful nation infamously tweeted: \"In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can't last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming [sic]? Please come back fast, we need you!\"","It goes without saying that whatever the US does or does not do to limit the effects of global warming impacts every single being, human or otherwise, on this planet.","Then comes the economy: in June last year, we were warned that tensions between the US and its main trading partners could precipitate global trade turmoil similar in scale to the 2008 financial crisis. Whoever gets to sit in the Oval Office, then, plays a major role in shaping the state of our wallets as well as the state of the planet. Is it really that outrageous that people around the world might want to have a say on who runs the show?","I am, of course, aware that the US is extremely unlikely to go along with my idea. This isn’t a country that’s particularly known for avidly seeking external input. And of course, there’s the idea that the right to vote is intrinsically tied to residence, and that those who don’t live in a given country aren’t qualified to make a call on what goes in said country.","Except things are more complicated, and more nuanced than that. Take, for example, the idea that living in a country is a condition to having the right to vote there. Permanent residents such as myself, also known as green card holders (also known as people who aren’t US citizens but live and work in the US full-time) pay the same income tax as US citizens, but don’t get to vote. Naturally, US citizens (like citizens of many other countries) still get to vote for their president even if they permanently move to a different country. All this to say: there is an established disequilibrium between who gets to vote in the US presidential election and who arguably has the most skin in the game.","Shape\n    Created with Sketch.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\nWho could be running against Trump in 2020?","1/23 Bernie Sanders","2/23  Hillary Clinton","3/23 Joe Biden","4/23 Kamala Harris","5/23 Elizabeth Warren","6/23 Beto O’Rourke","7/23 Wayne Messam","8/23 Kirsten Gillibrand","9/23 Cory Booker","10/23 John Delaney","11/23 Julian Castro","12/23 Tulsi Gabbard","13/23 Pete Buttigieg","14/23 Andrew Yang","15/23 Marianne Williamson","16/23 John Kerry","17/23 Michael Bloomberg","18/23 Howard Schultz","19/23 Eric Holder","20/23 Eric Swalwell","21/23 Terry McAuliffe","22/23 Sherrod Brown","23/23 Mitch Landrieu","1/23 Bernie Sanders","2/23  Hillary Clinton","3/23 Joe Biden","4/23 Kamala Harris","5/23 Elizabeth Warren","6/23 Beto O’Rourke","7/23 Wayne Messam","8/23 Kirsten Gillibrand","9/23 Cory Booker","10/23 John Delaney","11/23 Julian Castro","12/23 Tulsi Gabbard","13/23 Pete Buttigieg","14/23 Andrew Yang","15/23 Marianne Williamson","16/23 John Kerry","17/23 Michael Bloomberg","18/23 Howard Schultz","19/23 Eric Holder","20/23 Eric Swalwell","21/23 Terry McAuliffe","22/23 Sherrod Brown","23/23 Mitch Landrieu","How would it work, then? If the US were to entertain the possibility of letting foreigners participate in the presidential vote (and again, I’m not holding my breath), how would we make it happen? Does each foreign country get the same weight as each of the 50 states? Surely, that would be giving too much weight to the outside world. Do we restrict the vote to member states of NATO and/or historical allies? This seems slightly more realistic – as realistic as it gets in this purely hypothetical scenario – but also somewhat unfair to those whose voices would be left out.","I have clearly disclosed my status as a French citizen, so I know the question will be raised: how would I react if someone proposed to let other countries vote in the French presidential election? Well, France is currently about five spots behind the US in the ranking of the world’s most powerful nations, and its GDP is more than seven times lower. But sure, should France ever have the kind of political and cultural influence the US currently yields, then I’d be inclined to let others have a say.

Marijuana-infused foods and candies, called edibles, also led to trouble. Patients came to the ER with symptoms such as repeated vomiting, racing hearts and psychotic episodes.","The study, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, stemmed from tales of tourists needing emergency care after gobbling too many marijuana gummies.","\"It was hard to know if these were just anecdotes or if there was a true phenomenon,\" said lead author Dr. Andrew Monte of UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital.","Three deaths in Colorado tied to edible products also prompted the study.","Emergency room records from Monte's hospital show a three-fold increase in marijuana cases since the state became the first to allow sales of recreational marijuana in January 2014. Nearly a third of patients were admitted to the hospital, evidence of severe symptoms, Monte said.","In 2012, the ER saw an average of one patient every other day with a marijuana-caused problem. By 2016, the count was two to three per day.","That's not enough to swamp the emergency department, Monte said, but it stresses an already burdened system.","Most people can use marijuana safely, Monte said, but with its increased availability and higher THC concentrations, \"we may be seeing more adverse drug reactions,\" he said.","THC is the part of marijuana that gets people high.","A growing cannabis industry promotes the drug as a cure-all while downplaying dangers, said Dr. Erik Messamore, a psychiatrist at Northeast Ohio Medical University who wasn't involved in the research. More than 30 states now allow marijuana for at least medical use. New Jersey is debating becoming the 11th state to approve recreational pot. The U.S. government considers marijuana illegal.","\"You can't trust the people who sell the drugs to be upfront with the risk,\" Messamore said, calling for warning labels similar to those on tobacco products.","The analysis confirmed edibles are trouble. Statewide, they made up less than 1 percent of total cannabis sales, measured by THC content. Yet 11 percent of ER visits were triggered by edibles.","Monte said edibles are too dangerous to be part of the recreational marketplace. Slow to kick in, their effects last too long for a good party drug, he said. They work better for those who want to use them as medicine.","Yet information on safe dosing is lacking, as Denver resident Arlene Galchinsky learned. She took a marijuana gummy for pain on top of a prescription narcotic, becoming so disoriented her husband called paramedics. Galchinsky, 79, didn't go to the ER, but the experience shook her up.","\"It was extremely scary,\" she said of the feeling. \"When was this going to go away? It was so frightening.\"","In the state-funded study , there were 2,567 emergency visits at the Denver hospital caused by marijuana from 2012-2016. It's not just tourists; 9 out of 10 cases were Colorado residents.","Seventeen percent of the visits were for uncontrolled bouts of vomiting. It was most often from inhaled marijuana, not edibles.","Twelve percent of the cases were for acute psychosis, where people without a history of mental disorders lose touch with reality. That was more frequently seen with edibles.","Intoxication and heart problems were other common complaints.","In an editorial, Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, called for more research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. She and co-author Ruben Baler wrote there is an \"urgent need\" for greater oversight of manufacturing and labeling as marijuana use increases with state legalization.","Monte, an ER doctor who specializes in toxicology, doesn't use marijuana. \"I'm too busy,\" he said. \"I can't spend time being high.\"","Officials say rapper Nipsey Hussle shot and killed at 33","Game of Thrones takes over Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas","AP Exclusive: Harris' call for reform collides with her past","New Davis Cup goes virtual to increase sponsorship revenue","After shocking NY arrest, Avenatti faces court in California","StarTribune","Company","Advertise with us","Buy","Customer support","Website","© 2019 StarTribune.

The president’s description of it as a “witch hunt” was accurate.","I regularly acknowledged that I was putting my credibility on the line by stating that it was all a hoax. But how did I know that? After all, I wasn’t privy to any confidential intelligence.","One answer is I used common sense. The Trump-Russia collusion charge and the Donald-Trump-is-an-agent-of-the-Kremlin charge struck me — and tens of millions of other Americans — as absurd. Vladimir Putin’s influence on the 2016 election was negligible, and as president, Trump has been harder on Russia — in supporting Ukraine’s anti-Russian government, in fighting Syria’s pro-Russian government and in confronting Iran’s pro-Russian regime — than Barack Obama was.","But the biggest reason I never believed the Russian collusion charge was that the charge emanated from the left. And the left lies about everything. Truth is a liberal value, and truth is a conservative value, but it has never been a left-wing value. People on the left say whatever advances their immediate agenda. Power is their moral lodestar; therefore, truth is always subservient to it.","The left wanted to undo the 2016 presidential election from the day Trump won. So they made up the Russian collusion story. This was obvious to every conservative — except for “Never Trumpers,” who, with regard to Trump, have been indistinguishable from the left and were therefore as prepared as any leftist to believe the Trump-Russia collusion tale. We conservatives knew that a) the left wanted to invalidate the election and b) the left lies when it is in their interest to do so. So we knew the collusion charge was a fabrication.","We also suspected that the collusion hoax may well have been an effort to divert attention from the real crimes here: American intelligence agencies’ being used to spy on a presidential candidate for the first time in American history; getting Clinton off the hook for her illegal use of a private server while secretary of state; her use of that office to enrich herself and her husband; and her destruction of the evidence once her hidden emails were subpoenaed.","If you always doubt a leftist claim, you will almost always be closer to the truth. I employed that rule in concluding the collusion story was a fraud, and it served me well.","Name the issue and you will likely find a left-wing lie. The left claims our universities are saturated by a “culture of rape.” Not only is that a lie, but deep down, leftists know it’s a lie. The proof? Every left-wing parent who speaks about the “culture of rape” on college campuses sends his or her daughter to college. As no parents would ever send their daughter to an actual rape culture, left-wing parents who send their daughters to college know it is not really a rape culture. They say it is a rape culture solely to buttress the feminist argument that American males are misogynists and to provide young women with the highest status in the left-wing value system: victim.","Although I haven’t been a student or taught at a college in many decades, that’s how I knew American colleges were not rape cultures. I knew it because the left said they were. Again, just assume the left is lying and you will be close to arriving at the truth.","How do I know there are only two sexes? The most obvious reason is, again, common sense. But the second most powerful reason is the left denies there are only two sexes and claims there is no such thing as sex, only subjective “gender.” Last week, a writer for the left-wing magazine The Nation defended the victory of two high school male-bodied trans women who defeated all the female-bodied women in a Connecticut track competition — because, in his words, “trans women are in fact women.”","Now, we all know trans women are not in fact women, that they are biologically men who regard themselves as women. And in private life, I have no problem treating trans women as women if they look and dress female and take on a female name. But it is completely unjust to have them compete against born females in sports. They are not in fact women; they consider themselves women despite the facts. Again, assuming the left is lying to advance its agenda leads one to truth.","When the left tells us the Earth has 12 years left because of global warming, I assume they are not telling the truth. One bit of proof is that almost no one on the global-warming-will-destroy-life left advocates the safest, cheapest and most practical non-fossil-based source of energy: nuclear power. If they really believed life was existentially threatened by fossil-based fuel, they would be building nuclear reactors as fast they could make them. One reason I haven’t believed man-made global warming will destroy the Earth is that the left does.","So, while the latest left-wing lie — Trump-Russia collusion — is now exposed, there is little to cheer about. Without missing a beat, the left — the Democratic Party, the media and academia — will move on to another lie.","And there will be no soul-searching on the part of the media or the rest of the left.","Why won’t there be? Because no leftist acknowledges the collusion story was a lie.","Truth has never been a left-wing value. Like “gender,” it is whatever you want it to be.","Dennis Prager is a nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist.

Joining holdovers Star-Lord and Groot were Beta Ray Bill, Cosmic Ghost Rider, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell. The new Guardians came together when it was revealed that Thanos had found a way to resurrect himself in someone else's body following his death at the hands of Gamora in Infinity Wars.","With the thought of Thanos version 2.0 looming somewhere out in the galaxy, Starfox assembled all of Marvel's cosmic characters together with the idea of killing Gamora, who is the most likely suspect for the Mad Titan to choose as his vessel. When the Black Order attacked the reading of Thanos' will, the villains opened a black hole to kill the heroes while they stole Thanos' corpse.","RELATED: Marvel's Evil Guardians of the Guardians' First Target Isn't Who You Think","Cosmic Ghost Rider, Beta Ray Bill, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell escaped to warn Star-Lord and Groot of what took place, but they weren't the only survivors. Starfox, Guardian of the Shi'ar Empire, Nebula and Wraith teamed up to become the Dark Guardians, with Cosmic Ghost Rider ditching the heroic Guardians to join their ranks. Now, a manhunt is underway for Gamora, who has gone underground following her heel turn in Infinity Wars. Of course, you'd think Star-Lord would be all for warning Gamora before the Dark Guardians learn of her whereabouts, but that isn't the case. Thankfully, there is a character willing to do whatever it takes to help his former teammate, even if it means commandeering leadership of the Guardians of the Galaxy from Star-Lord.","All Hail Captain Groot","Infinity Wars saw Gamora go on quite a kill spree -- going by the moniker Requiem, Gamora killed  Thanos and Star-Lord, two men who were quite close to her. The use of the Time Stone to rewind time is the only reason Star-Lord is still alive, but that hasn't taken away his memory of being betrayed by Gamora. Guardians of the Galaxy #1-2 have shown Peter Quill mentally struggling to get over being killed and brought back to life, which has left him numb to all the chaos currently ongoing in the galaxy.","When Groot and the rest of the Guardians decide to go help Gamora, Star-Lord refuses to get involved, leaving Groot with no choice but to relieve Peter of his command over the Guardians of the Galaxy, thereby becoming the team's new leader.","We also find out Groot has named Beta Ray Bill as his second officer, meaning Groot doesn't believe Star-Lord is even fit enough to be his second-in-command. Groot takes control of the Ryder, leaving Star-Lord no choice but to tag along, whether he likes it or not.","Before the issue concludes, Peter reveals Gamora is on Halfworld in search of Rocket, which could bring another former Guardian back into the series.","RELATED: Thanos' Final Gauntlet May Tear the Marvel Universe Apart","Groot entered Infinity Wars in his Baby Groot form, but left it transformed with the ability to speak in complete sentences -- though he still refers to himself in the third person. This transition makes his new position as the Guardians' Captain even more entertaining, because we know exactly what he's saying. No more guessing games -- Groot is now in charge.","Tags:\nguardians of the galaxy,\nfeature","Leave A Comment","More in CBR Exclusives","Will Big Bang Theory Finally Fix Its Longest-Running Problem?","Humphries & Quinones Explore DC's Secret History in Dial H for Hero","Jordan Peele May Be This Generation's Alfred Hitchcock","Will The Big Bang Theory Finale Take Us Back to the Future?","Mystic Gohan: Dragon Ball Z’s Strangest Form, Explained","Us Could Be Universal's Solution to Its Dark Universe Problem","A Gay Captain Marvel Could Be The MCU's Biggest Statement on Diversity","Arrow Just Upended Black Siren's Precarious Status Quo","Marvel's Avengers Have Recruited a New Four-Legged Member","REVIEW: Heroes in Crisis Digs Its Hooks in Deeper With Issue 7","The Heroverse Comes Calling in Dial H for Hero #1","Detective Comics #1000 is a Wonderful Celebration of Batman's Legacy","Spider-Man: Life Story #1 is a Wonderful Idea Marred by Bland Execution","REVIEW: Batman #67 is Not Going to Be for Everyone","Spider-Man: City at War #1 (Too) Faithfully Adapts Sony's Hit Video Game","PREVIEW: Heroes in Crisis #7","PREVIEW: Dial H For Hero #1","PREVIEW: Detective Comics #1000","Hit-Girl Season Two #3","Trending Now","Naruto: The Tragedy of Neji Hyūga and the Lasting Legacy of His Death","EXCL: Amanda Waller Learns Another Superman Secret in Action Comics #1009","Review: Dumbo Is Disney's Most Original Live-Action Remake Yet","CBR.com values your privacy.

For me, that included limiting red meat, avoiding fast food and exercising at least twice a week. Given how formulaic that sounded, I wondered how much results vary for others.","It turns out everyone gets the same 10 habits, since those are the ones 23andMe decided to survey people about. But the order in which they’re listed varies to indicate the magnitude of their supposed effect for you. Alisa Lehman, senior product scientist for 23andMe, said the top two habits for most people are limiting red meat and avoiding fast food, as they were for me.","Like many other nutrition studies, the findings do not establish cause-and-effect relationships, but are links the company makes between customers’ genes and the survey results.","Other wellness reports said I’m more likely to be lactose intolerant (check), to flush when drinking alcohol (check) and to consume less caffeine (check). They were more interesting because of their specificity, but didn’t reveal anything surprising. Another report said my weight isn’t likely to be affected by my intake of saturated fat, which is commonly found in meat.","The only surprise was learning I have a genetic variant “common in elite power athletes.” When I followed the link, however, I saw about half of customers have the same variant.","DNAFit","For $99.99, you get a saliva collection to produce reports on a variety of fitness and dietary traits. If you already have your DNA file from 23andMe, you can upload it to get instant results for $79.","DNAFit says its reports are based on the broader universe of scientific research about genes and diet.","Given the general fear of carbs among many dieters, I started with the “carbohydrate sensitivity” report. It started with an overview explaining the difference between complex carbs like brown rice and refined carbs like sugar that are digested more quickly.","After scrolling down, the report said I have a “very low” sensitivity, meaning I’m less susceptible than others to sugar highs and diabetes. Despite this carb tolerance, it suggested I limit refined carbs to 10 per cent of daily calories. Again, this sounded like fairly generic advice and made me wonder how much the recommendations vary for others.","Andrew Steele, head of product at DNAFit, said that depending on people’s sensitivity, the recommended limit for refined carbs ranges from 6 to 10 per cent of total calories. For someone who eats 2,500 calories a day, that’s a range from 150 calories to 250 calories.","While that may not seem like a big difference, DNAFit notes cutting back from 10 to 6 per cent would mean a 40 per cent reduction. Still, the relatively tight range reinforces the idea that dietary advice would be largely consistent regardless of your genes.","Another report said my sensitivity to saturated fat is low, and suggested limiting it to 10 per cent of calories. DNAFit said the range for that recommendation is also 6 to 10 per cent.","Other reports were more nutrient specific. One said I have a raised need for omega-3, the cholesterol-lowering fatty acid. Another said I have a raised risk for DNA damage from chargrilled meats and should limit them. (This advice was provided over an image of candle-lit steak.)","On the fitness side, the reports said I’m more prone to endurance activities than high intensity activities. I don’t know if I’ll take this into consideration if I start exercising. Others have questioned the accuracy of the fitness reports, which rated one Olympic runner’s aerobic potential as “medium.”","DNAFit and 23andMe say knowing your genetic predisposition can motivate you to stick with diet or exercise routines. You may also have specific reasons for wanting to try the services, particularly 23andMe, which most get for the ancestry tests and provides many other reports. But for me, the findings from both felt too broad to influence my habits.","One small note: DNAFit is based in the United Kingdom, so if you decide to try it, you may notice a small currency exchange fee on your credit card statement.","——–","Follow Candice Choi at http://www.twitter.com/candicechoi","——","The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

This site uses cookies to improve your experience and deliver personalised advertising. You can opt out at any time or find out more by reading our cookie policy.","By\n                                            Victoria Murphy","Baby Sussex has not even been born, but already he or she has filled more column inches, taken up more hours of air time, and generated more online clicks than almost all of us will throughout our lifetimes. This unprecedented level of worldwide interest in someone born seventh in line to the throne will, of course, only increase when the child arrives. And while he or she will be largely oblivious to their position for the first few years, teaching them how to manage the spotlight in the internet age will be just one of the things Harry and Meghan have to factor into their parenting.","Born into the world’s most famous royal family to parents who are two of its current stars, this child’s life is not set up to be “ordinary”. However, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do want to give their son or daughter the chance to experience life outside the royal bubble. This is all the more important because their descendants are not destined for a future filled with royal duties and will instead be expected to carve out their own careers. In the same way that Prince William’s cousins are not full-time working royals, any children Harry has will fall too far down the pecking order to have their lives mapped out with a royal role.","Advertisement","This relative freedom is likely to excite Harry and Meghan who I expect will want their child to be exposed to lots of different opportunities so they can choose for themselves where they want to focus their attention. Harry was sporty as a child before thriving in the army and has championed sport and the military in his charitable work. Former actress Meghan found her love of acting growing up and took part in school plays before deciding to study theatre and international relations at university. Telling staff at Bristol Old Vic Theatre in February she thought creative arts and theatre were “equally as important” as sport in schools, it seems clear that Meghan will encourage any creative streak her child has.","The duchess also developed a strong interest in gender equality from an early age, successfully campaigning age 11 to change a sexist TV commercial. Palace aides have dismissed claims she will bring her child up “gender fluid”, but Meghan has made it clear that she wants to pass on her belief in equality amongst the sexes. During a panel discussion on International Women’s Day, she said about a documentary she watched: “One of the things they said during pregnancy was I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism. I loved that. So boy or girl or whatever it is, we hope that that's the case with our little bump.\"","Read next","Meet Italian millionaire Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi: Princess Beatrice's new boyfriend","The Italian property tycoon who's swept the princess off her feet","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Having started their married life in what is often described as the “goldfish bowl” of west London’s Kensington Palace, the Sussexs hope to be in Windsor by the time their child is born. With Frogmore Cottage undergoing large-scale structural renovations at the taxpayers’ expense (the couple will pay for their own fixtures and fittings) it is expected that they will make the property their home for several years. The idyllic, rural spot is just 25 miles from their new offices at Buckingham Palace but offers a completely different lifestyle to the intensity of the capital. With the 5,000-acre Windsor Great Park on their doorstep the family can enjoy the outdoors while still being a stone’s throw from Windsor’s many shops and cafes. However, if they want to be certain of avoiding attention from the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the picturesque town every year, they may choose to spend their down time behind closed doors. Close friends George and Amal Clooney, who have toddler twins, have a house 30 minutes drive from Frogmore Cottage in Sonning, and longtime confidante Elton John and his husband David Furnish have a house on the edge of the Great Park. The Queen and Prince Philip spend many weekends and every Easter at Windsor Castle. Cousins George, Charlotte and baby Louis will be natural playmates although the move away from Kensington Palace means that the cousins won’t grow up constantly popping round to say hello.","Like William and Kate, Meghan and Harry want to play pivotal roles in their children’s lives rather than leave this to nannies. Meghan’s mum Doria, to whom she is very close and Harry has described as “amazing”, is expected to visit often and play a key role, although she will continue to live in Los Angeles. However, the couple will almost certainly get professional help, especially once they both resume royal duties. As well as potential nannies they may also choose to follow the Cambridges’ decision to send their child to a local nursery and will eventually have the pick of Windsor’s top schools.","Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie grew up in Windsor and both went to Upton House school, which takes girls and boys into the nursery from age two, followed by Coworth Park then St George’s School. Harry’s old primary Ludgrove, which he attended from age eight, is a 30-minute drive away. His secondary school, Eton, is even closer at just a 20-minute walk from Windsor Castle. However, just as William and Kate have not chosen William’s old primary school for George, Harry and Meghan may also opt for somewhere completely different.","Even the future king is just called George by his teachers and classmates, and baby Sussex is sure to follow suit and be treated like everyone else in the classroom. What his or her title will be outside that is still to be determined. King George V limited titles within the royal family in 1917 meaning that the option of an HRH Prince or Princess would only be on the table if The Queen steps in and issues a Letters Patent. If Harry and Meghan don’t want this, as the eldest son of a duke, a boy would inherit one of his father’s subsidiary titles and be called Earl of Dumbarton. A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor and any subsequent sons would be Lord (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.","Advertisement","Such things will be largely irrelevant when it comes to what sort of life this child will lead. It goes without saying that he or she will almost certainly never want for anything material. However, Harry and Megan - who was once a jobbing actress working to make ends meet - will be keen to make sure that their child is not spoiled or entitled.","It is pretty much impossible that this baby can ever inherit the throne - for example Prince Michael of Kent was born seventh in line and now at age 76 will become 48th after the birth of baby Sussex. That said, the sons of Princess Diana grew up side by side in the full - and equal - glare of the spotlight, meaning that the interest in Harry gives this family a unique place in the hearts and minds of many around the world. The fascination with the Sussexs could lessen significantly as time passes, with the focus shifting towards George, Charlotte and Louis as the future of the monarchy. Yet, with celebrity culture existing around the world like never before and the internet and social media making falling out of the spotlight almost impossible, it could be the case that the Sussex family’s prominence never really fades.","The path that this baby’s life will take is not pre-determined. The huge interest in the road ahead for him or her most certainly is.","Share this article","Recommended","Royals","Royal baby name predictions for Baby Sussex","From traditional monikers like Victoria and James, to wildcard choices like Amelia and Spencer","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Rebecca Cope","Duchess of Sussex","The Duchess of Sussex is pregnant","There's a new royal baby on the way","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Tatler","Royals","What life was really like on-board Royal Yacht Britannia","Water fights, Carry-On-style sketches, afternoon tea and more","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Travel","A royal guide to Morocco","What the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should be ticking off their to-do list...","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Ashley Pearson"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Maybe you're the party animal, dancing on tables and singing at the top of your lungs. Maybe you're the drama queen, getting teary-eyed and overly emotional over a text you sent your ex two months ago. Or perhaps you're the ray of sunshine, complimenting the outfits of everyone at the bar and insisting you'll all hang out sometime. According to research, your drunk alter ego isn't a separate identity at all. That's the real you, pal.","Debunk Your Drunk","If you're of legal drinking age, we've got news — whether it's news you're ready to cope with or not. Research says that your drunk self is probably not as far off from your actual personality as you think it is. Though it may feel like you're a completely different person when you're in the club getting tipsy, a 2017 study published in Clinical Psychological Science found that your drunk persona doesn't differ from your sober one, more or less. Basically, you're always that special, unique, wonderful you, no matter how many tequila shots you foolishly ended up taking on your birthday.","Sloshed for Science","For the study, the researchers from University of Missouri and Purdue University sought to find out if \"drunk personalities\" are a thing or not. They specifically tested if \"differences between sober and intoxicated personality expression can be observed reliably\" by friends during some drunk game-playing. Two weeks prior to the experiment, the researchers had the 156 participants complete surveys describing their typical sober and drunk personalities. Next, the team gave half of the participants booze, then had their friends join them in the lab to play games meant to bring out different personality traits. The drinkers rated their own in-the-moment personality traits during the session while trained (and sober) raters assessed the same traits. While the drinkers noted personality differences in themselves while drunk, the sober onlookers didn't see any big differences between their sober and drunk personalities. Except for one thing: the drinks made those participants more extroverted. Obviously.","Related Video: The Science of Hangovers","\"We were surprised to find such a discrepancy between drinkers' perceptions of their own alcohol-induced personalities and how observers perceived them,\" said lead author Rachel Winograd, a psychological scientist at University of Missouri, in a press release. \"Participants reported experiencing differences in all factors of the Five Factor Model of personality, but extraversion was the only factor robustly perceived to be different across participants in alcohol and sober conditions.\"","As for why you feel like an entirely different being when you've been a bit overserved? Probably just the placebo effect. If you have it in your head that tequila makes you wild or wine makes you emotional, you'll make those expectations come true all on your own.

And since no plot details or even a title has been announced for the project, fans are pretty much at liberty to spin whatever theory they want about the movie, including the suggestion that it might be the long-awaited Green Lantern Corps film.","Thomas Polito of Geeks WorldWide recently took to Twitter with a couple of posts observing some vague similarities between the two Warner Bros projects. For one thing, the Nolan movie’s July 17th, 2020, release date falls somewhat close to the June 19th date that was announced back in 2015 for Green Lantern Corps.","On top of that, it’s argued that recently reported cast members Robert Pattinson and John David Washington would make good fits for Hal Jordan and Jon Stewart, respectively. Lastly, it’s suggested that the “age-appropriate female lead” and “older male co-star” that Nolan is reportedly looking for could be referring to Carol Ferris and Sinestro.","MORE FROM THE WEB","Though Polito may not have been 100% serious in his speculation, fans are already sold on the idea, even if most of them will need a lot more evidence than this to start believing that the Dark Knight helmsman is returning to superhero cinema. And while it’s currently looking highly unlikely that a Green Lantern Corps film will even come out in 2020 – let alone that Nolan’s the one directing it – surely there’s no harm in letting people dream a while.","In any case, with Nolan’s movie set to begin filming this summer, we can hopefully expect a few more details to emerge in the coming months. Either way, we’ll find out what the director’s been secretly cooking up when it arrives in theaters on July 17th, 2020.","Source:  Twitter","MORE NEWS FROM THE WEB","TRENDING","You May Like…","Familiar Faces Return In First Fear The Walking Dead Season 5 Trailer","X-Men: Dark Phoenix Producer Says Disney Deal Isn’t Why The Franchise Is Ending","The Mandalorian Reportedly Expected To Land A Second Season","Zoe Saldana Breaks The Silence On James Gunn’s Return To Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3","David Ramsey Reportedly Leaving The Arrowverse This Season Or Next","New Avengers: Endgame Toy Confirms Thanos’ Attack On [SPOILERS]","Another New Weapon’s Been Revealed For Thanos In Avengers: Endgame","2021 Is Looking To Be The Biggest Year For Star Trek Ever","Why The Original Iron Man Still Holds Up After More Than A Decade","Mark Hamill Previews Chucky’s New Voice For Child’s Play Reboot","Avengers: Endgame Ticket On-Sale Date Finally Confirmed","New Aladdin Trailer Invites Us To Explore A Whole New World","Arrow Producers Release Statement On Emily Bett Rickards’ Exit","New Avengers: Endgame LEGO Sets Launch With Tons Of Spoilers","Avengers: Endgame Funko Pop!

But that time is gone. The Larry Nassar scandal and rising backlash against bullying make what Izzo did during Thursday's NCAA tournament game feel more uncomfortable and more risky.","Izzo loyalists, who include much of the press, dismiss the raging bull episode as part of the Michigan State University coach's schtick — the way he motivates his players, the way he teaches them to win.","\"That's just Izzo,\" they say. \"That's the way he's always been.\"","But there's no grandfather clause for abusive conduct. Just because he's got away with it for decades, doesn't mean it won't bite MSU in the butt today.","The world has changed. There's nothing funny about watching someone in a position of authority berate, intimidate and humiliate one of his charges.","Izzo's outburst during the win against Bradley went beyond a coach dressing down a player. That happens with nearly every coach, in every game, at least at the collegiate level. In the pros, where players are more empowered, there's more restraint.","Izzo approached freshman Aaron Henry, who'd been slacking on defense, as if he intended to physically attack him. Later, in a sideline huddle, the coach lunged out of his chair at Henry, who was trying to plead his case..","In both instances, other players got between the coach and Henry, moving Izzo back.","It appeared on television as if Izzo was just an impulse away from a career-ending Bobby Knight or Woody Hayes moment. He seemed unhinged.","Maybe he was actually under control, as his devotees insist, and it was all part of a carefully considered act. I've not covered Izzo, and don't know him.","But still, MSU should be worried that Izzo, like Knight, who famously threw a chair, and Hayes, who punched an opposing player, will cross the line during one of his red-faced rages and do something to further sully the university's reputation.","While they may be playing on a big-time stage, these players are still basically kids. Henry is a teen-ager. The freshman shrugged off the incident after the game, saying he faces worse during practices.","If that's true, Izzo and his program need a lot more oversight from a university administration that will pay the price if he snaps.","But don't hold your breath. The culture at MSU hasn't changed so much that either the administration or the board are willing to meddle with a coach their fan base has so deified.","nfinley@detroitnews.com","Catch “The Nolan Finley Show” weekdays 7-9 a.m. on 910 AM Superstation."],"targetCaptions":[]}

You could be getting a 16% return on your money right now, and it’s not that hard to do.","As Mark Cuban, the “Shark Tank” star, billionaire entrepreneur, and NBA franchise owner explains, just pay off your debts.","Americans carry an enormous amount of personal debt. The personal finance site NerdWallet put our revolving credit card balance at $420.22 billion in late 2018.","That’s not considering total credit card debt, which is $944 billion, or the multiple trillions in mortgage, auto and student loan debt. The revolving number is just the credit card debt we carry from month to month.","It works out to $6,929 per U.S. household. Meanwhile, according to Credit Karma, the average rate on that debt was 15.96%.","Pay that off and you stop losing nearly 16% in compounding negative returns.","“The reason for that is whatever interest you have — it might be a student loan with a 7% interest rate — if you pay off that loan, you’re making 7%,” Cuban said.","“And so that’s your immediate return, which is a lot safer than trying to pick a stock, or trying to pick real estate or whatever it may be.”","Juicy returns","Do you think you can find a stock that will return 16% in the next year? Do you think your retirement portfolio will grow that quickly?","Of course not. Whatever short-run investment you make that promises juicy returns forces you to run the risk of equally powerful losses.","Long-term investments are safer, but there you have to contend with what academics call “reversion to the mean,” the tendency for investments to average out over the years.","Stocks from 1950 to 2018 returned 11.1% annually. Bonds returned 5.8%. If you had a 50/50 stock and bond portfolio, you averaged 8.8%.","How’s that 16% looking now?","Look, it’s hard to pay off debts. Being debt-free (or at least credit-card debt free) requires immediate sacrifice.","That’s vacations not taken. Car repairs delayed. Cooking at home and not relaxing in a restaurant on the weekend or for workday lunches.","Yet the cost of not paying off your high-interest debts is astronomical.","Let’s say you have exactly the typical American household credit balance of $6,929 and carry it for 20 years at 16%. You end up paying $135,038.","Now let’s say you invested that amount instead and earned 8.8% over 20 years. You end up with $37,486.","You should invest, the earlier the better. But, truthfully, the math strongly advises that you pay off any high-interest debt you carry as soon as humanly possible.","A positive force","The power of compounding returns can be a positive force in your financial life. Even if you’re starting late and retirement is only a decade off, starting is the key.","Most people underestimate how long they might live. They spend today like there is no tomorrow. If they invest at all, they make short-run bets rather than taking the safer, more compelling long-term investment.","And, too often, we discount the value of mathematically sound financial planning.","There are many unknowns about the stock market, the economy, politics and world events. Mostly, though, stocks go up regardless of the headlines.","Meanwhile, the things we can estimate well — our personal indebtedness, housing costs, health expenses, Social Security and the cost of living — we tend to ignore.","A better retirement plan process takes into account all of the knowns and compares them to likely long-term investment scenarios. By working with a qualified financial planning professional, you can settle your mind about retirement after just a few consultations.","And, yes, paying down debt will be part of that plan. As Cuban argues, the best way to get ahead is to make sure you’re not falling behind thanks to high-cost debt.","Mitch\n                                                    Tuchman","Mitch Tuchman brings the low-cost, scientific investment approach used by elite pensions and endowments to everyday retirement investors through Rebalance.

The next step? Scaling that momentum.","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["Search form","Buttigieig raised enough to qualify for the first Democratic debate. The next step? Scaling that momentum.","Pete Buttigieg is having a moment.","After appearing at an hour-long CNN Town Hall in Austin, Texas last week, Buttigieg is on the rise. Over the weekend, he received donations from 65,000 people, which automatically qualified him to appear at the Democratic National Committee’s debate this June. That’s a pretty major milestone for an out  gay mayor of a smaller Midwest city, who a whole lot of Democrats probably couldn’t name at the beginning of the year.","The South Bend, Indiana mayor made a strong showing during the town hall, not only prompting a $600,000 surge of donations, but perhaps more importantly, Democrats and left-leaning independents wanting to know more about him. According to Google Trends, searches for his name have spiked in the last week.","Sure, Buttigieg, 37, would not be the first openly gay man to run for president (that was Fred Karger, running for the Republicans in 2012). And he has a great deal of name recognition to contend with among the pack of other candidates also vying for the Democratic ticket: Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and potentially Vice President Joe Biden, to name a few, all of whom have been figures on the national stage for years.","Currently 62 percent of most likely Democratic primary voters say they’ve never heard of Buttigieg, according to a Morning Consult poll. He’s also polling at just one percent, tying for eight place with Montana Gov. Steve Bullock. Sure, it’s low, but Buttigieg was polling at zero percent at the end of February.","The same poll shows Buttigieg’s favorability at 13 percent and a relatively low “unfavorability” rating at 7 percent, while another 18 percent say they’ve heard of him but have no opinion.","With more eyes on Buttigieg, he’s been seizing the moment; many of the points made to CNN and elsewhere are things he’s been saying for some time, particularly, “I have more years of government experience under my belt than the president. I also have more years of executive government experience than the vice president, and more military experience than anybody to walk into that office on day one since George H. W. Bush.”","But notably, anecdotes about who he is as a person are trickling out. There was that time, according to Time reporter Anand Giridharadas, that Buttigieg started speaking Norwegian to a journalist at the drop of a hat, explaining that he learned the language to read the books of an author whose work was only available in Norwegian. His remarks to the Muslim people in his community after the deadly shooting in New Zealand were more articulate than President Trump’s reaction to the extremist’s actions. And of course, there are Buttigieg memes.","pic.twitter.com/MtOhRn3ccX","— Eric Williams (@Eric_Williams_1) March 18, 2019","Democrats shouldn’t discount the unprecedented excitement for an out, gay candidate being taken seriously. He may be polling at one percent now, but there was a time not too long ago that even having an openly gay man running for president would be laughable at best, and at worst, opening him up for ignorant treatment or threats of violence.","All of this is to say, Buttigieg is riding a wave. Will he ride it all the way to the White House? With a crowded field and low name recognition, his chances aren’t exactly high. Still, Democrats couldn’t pick a more stark opponent for the Vice Presidential debates in fall 2020: Buttigieg versus Pence? We’d like to see it.","RELATED | Pete Buttigieg Doesn’t Want to Make America Great 'Again'","From our Sponsors","READER COMMENTS ()","Latest News"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Barr will have to weave through them all, and only specific doors can be opened as options for how to handle the document a Mueller probe security official dropped off at the Justice Department.","Regulations laid out by the General Powers of Special Counsel say that Mueller should give the attorney general a “confidential report” that explains why he charged some individuals and not others. Barr’s mandate is to inform lawmakers that he received the report, which he did Friday evening.","There is no rule that says Barr has to release a comprehensive more final document or to release the submitted Mueller investigation file. However, there is the Justice Manual to take into account which outlines policies surrounding such public disclosures.","What it all comes down to is that the Justice Department believes that there is “no legitimate government interest served” by making public information about an individual who is not facing any criminal charges.","Though federal law says that there could be exceptions, according to analysis from legal reporters, only Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have the power to make a one-off exception to include the actions of an individual not being prosecuted in the report and not redact it.","The Democrats and potentially some Republicans say that the Russia investigation is outside the norm and thus the report should be released in full, instead of a summary or briefing on the contents.","Barr made clear in his letter to Congress that he could brief them on the report as early as this weekend. However, count on Democratic uproar if all the lawmakers receive is a bullet point list.","It should be noted that both Democrats and President Donald Trump himself, who has vehemently denied collusion with Russia to get elected, have continuously called for the Mueller report to be released ahead of Friday.","Last week, with Trump’s support, the House of Representatives voted in an unanimous ballot in favour of a non-binding resolution calling for the Russia probe file to be released to the public upon completion. Currently, Trump favours the attorney general and they appear to be allies.","With Trump, Republicans and Democrats on one side, all appearing to support the full release — Trump because he believes it will vindicate him and Democrats because they say they’re in search of the truth — then who stands in the way?","Rosenstein has indicated support for a more toned down report.","(c)Breaking911 – Eli Ridder","comments","Recent Posts"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Club, as well as the content of Peele’s statement. - ED","With a $70 million opening weekend for Us, Jordan Peele is officially two for two–and in more ways than one. Both of Peele’s feature directorial efforts have been horror films starring black actors in leading roles and they’ve broken box office records upon release; one of them–Get Out–even won an Oscar. And with his Twilight Zone reboot premiering next week on CBS All Access, Peele is quickly becoming one of the most prolific and acclaimed creatives on the planet, thanks in part to his focus on telling stories with diverse casts. So, what will he do next? According to The Hollywood Reporter, Peele says he’s going to keep using his position to explore stories that aren’t led by white people.","Advertisement","While speaking to students at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Hollywood this week, Peele explained how his success has given him leverage in filmmaking–specifically with regards to casting black actors in leading roles. As Peele has previously stated, unlike Get Out, Us isn’t about race;  it was also “very important” for him “to have a Black family at the center of a horror film.” Peele’s talk at UCB seemed to extend that particular conversation, with the filmmaker explaining that he has no intention of making movies with white actors in leading roles anytime soon. “I don’t see myself casting a white dude as the lead in my movie,” Peele said. “Not that I don’t like white dudes, but I’ve seen that movie.”","And it’s true: We’ve all seen that movie. Thousands of times. That’s part of what makes Peele’s filmmaking and his perspective so vital and fantastic, especially in Us, where the family’s race isn’t necessarily important to the story or understanding the film’s themes. Peele went on to acknowledge that he’s currently in a position of privilege in Hollywood, and one that he’s using to his advantage: “The way I look at it, I get to cast black people in my movies. I feel fortunate to be in this position where I can say to Universal, ‘I want to make a $20 million horror movie with a black family.’ And they say yes.”","Up next for Peele is the aforementioned Twilight Zone reboot, which he hosts and executive produces, and features a diverse cast including Kumail Nanjiani, John Cho, Steven Yeun, DeWanda Wise, and Jessica Williams. Peele’s Monkeypaw productions banner is also behind the upcoming remake of Candyman from director Nia DaCosta, starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Teyonah Parris.","Advertisement","Share This Story","Related Stories","We're sold on this insane Us theory","Jordan Peele recounts the first scary story he ever told","Jordan Peele's actual horror movie debut was this anti-smoking PSA","You may also like","How to Access the 'Snake' Easter Egg in Google Maps","5 Mysteries Surrounding the Life and Death of Dr. Sebi","It's a Cold Day in Hell on The Walking Dead Season Finale","Recent from Britt Hayes","Facebook is separating itself from white separatists","Oh Jesus Christ, here's the trailer for Mary Magdalene","Final Killing Eve season two trailer proves Villanelle will do some hideous things for love"],"targetCaptions":[]}

In the 365 days since her marriage, Meghan Markle has divided, but has she conquered, asks David Jenkins","By\n                                            Tatler","It’s tricky, being Meghan Markle. Even when people are sticking up for you, they’re sticking the knife in you, too. Take Suzanne Moore in The Guardian. She wrote a piece knocking the tabloids for going on about the Duchess of Sussex’s habit of cradling her bump, which was decent of her. But, she added, Meghan was not allowed to feel protective of her baby because ‘her job is to breed in captivity’. That must have gone down well with the self-proclaimed feminist and activist – who, it’s true, abandoned her socially conscious online accounts once she got married.","But she’s damned if she does, and she’s damned if she doesn’t. Write stirring messages on bananas for sex workers, and the Daily Mail derides you. Get a Grenfell cookbook published, and there are whispers of disapproval from courtiers. Hang out with the Clooney/Beckham/Soho House set and be assailed for being too Hollywood, for forcing your hen-pecked husband to abandon his old, country-set muckers – including Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, the ultra-loyal, tight-lipped Harry pal, who, it’s said, advised Harry not to marry Meghan and has paid the price: banishment.","Advertisement","It’s been there from the beginning, that criticism. Very shortly after her engagement was announced, I had dinner with some old-fashioned grandees, one of whom has connections with Kensington Palace. Meghan came up in conversation. ‘She’s trouble,’ said one peer. ‘I’m not at all sure it’s a good thing.’ The KP-connectee sighed: yes, he said, that’s what a few people there felt. It’s always the way; courtiers are plus royaliste que le roi – more royalist than the king himself. Remember poor Fergie, aka Sarah, Duchess of York. When she married Prince Andrew, the Queen’s second son, she, like Meghan, was heralded as a breath of fresh air, a fun-filled redhead who’d blow the cobwebs off the monarchy. In the end, Lord Charteris of Amisfield, one-time Private Secretary to the Queen, declared, ‘She is vulgar, vulgar, vulgar, and that is that.’ Even The Independent wrote that Fergie had ‘exuberantly expensive bad taste, a voracious appetite for publicity and swallowed up large amounts of money.’","Meghan has seen nothing like that – even though staff at Kensington Palace are now calling her ‘Me-Gain’. And savvy – but well-informed and well-connected – outsiders feel she’s getting bad advice. And that that advice comes not from palace regulars, but from Meghan’s own connections. Connections who are blamed for Meghan’s apparent decision to let friends brief People magazine about her dire relations with her father, her hand in writing Harry’s speeches, her nail polish, her cooking and her trust in God. Eyebrows rose even higher during her luxurious New York trip and the ‘Marie Antoinette’ overtones of her baby shower,  which included four Ladurée macaron towers costing $350 each. ‘She needs some pros,’ said an image-business source, ‘because the advice she’s been getting is crap.’ He paused, then added, ‘Which is odd. I’ve met her two or three times, and she’s quite a pro. She knows exactly what she wants. But she’s almost dealing with everything herself, and that’s dangerous.’","Read next","Meet Italian millionaire Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi: Princess Beatrice's new boyfriend","The Italian property tycoon who's swept the princess off her feet","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","All this won’t go down well with her new husband. ‘Harry’s a proud man,’ said one insider, ‘and a sensitive man. He’d be very upset at the idea of people criticising his wife. He’s utterly besotted.’ This upset is, of course, reflected in the couple’s notorious Christmas card: black and white, their backs to the viewer, arms around each other, the sky alive with fireworks which you could, if you wished to, construe as shellfire. Was it meant to be arty, or cool, unlike the bland happy-families shot sent by William and Catherine? Was it a proclamation of us-against-the-world, as many ‘body language experts’ claimed? The photograph was taken on the couple’s wedding day, a day of unalloyed triumph, a day of radiance, a day of happiness, after what Prince Charles told one source was the ‘nightmare’ of the wedding preparations.","Advertisement","‘Utterly besotted’ is spot on. (Palace denizens, who used to favour Harry over the petulant William, now complain that it’s impossible ever to catch the Duke of Sussex’s eye; he’s always gazing, cow-eyed with devotion, at his wife.) And the besottedness was clearly immediate. Violet von Westenholz brought the couple together, and two dates later Harry whisked Meghan off to Botswana where, he said, ‘We camped out with each other under the stars, sharing a tent and all that stuff. It was fantastic.’ That was in August 2016; look at Harry looking at Meghan, and it’s clear that nothing’s changed.","Alas, nothing much has changed with the press, either. Come 8 November 2016, and Prince Harry’s Communications Secretary issued an extraordinary statement: ‘This past week,’ it said, ‘has seen a line crossed. His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public – the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racist undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. Some of this has been hidden...’ It went on to talk of Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, having to struggle past photographers and the attempts of reporters and photographers to gain illegal entry to her home.","Read next","Princess Beatrice brings her new boyfriend on a family trip to the Bahrain Grand Prix","It’s getting serious","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Unprecedented, that. But applauded, in most quarters – though the statement was released as the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were on an official tour of the Middle East; Clarence House can’t have been best pleased that its timing knocked their engagements into the back pages. Still, the brouhaha gave good reason for Meghan to consider whether her prince was worth the destruction of her privacy. It’s one thing to be an ambitious actress playing the PR game; quite another to be en route to a wedding with a worldwide audience of 1.9 billion.","Advertisement","But on the couple sailed. There was gossip – of course there was. That Prince Charles had met Meghan, been fascinated by her, but told a friend, ‘I just hope he doesn’t marry her’; that later, admiringly yet overwhelmedly, he compared her to ‘tungsten’, conjuring up that metal to describe her strength of character. That Harry could barely keep his hands off her at Skippy’s wedding in Jamaica in March 2017. All well and good. We loved it. But one Hollywood friend of mine shook his head and said, ‘She’s a piece of work,’ which, in LA terms, is not a compliment. Her website, The Tig (for Tignanello, an Italian wine), was scoured for insights: ‘running around a city and trying to get into clubs wearing headbands of the phallic persuasion’ on a hen night, she wrote, would not be ‘on brand’; another post read ‘everything tastes better with a little hot sauce.’ She was, it became clear, big on homeopathic medicine and holistic remedies. And, she told another blog, ‘I learned [on film sets] how happy people would be when I walked in with a tray of perfect crudités’ – a forerunner, perhaps, of the ice-cream and sorbet stand friends told People magazine she’d bought for her office at Kensington Palace: ‘I came by one day,’ the friend reported, and ‘they [the staff] were remarking how it was “the best day of work ever.”’ Love was in the air. Her ex-husband, very properly, kept his counsel. But...","Well, Gina Nelthorpe Cowne, a former agent of the duchess, noticed a difference in late 2016. She met her in 2014 when Meghan was enthusiastic about working with the Young World Conference, a youth summit that aimed to inspire 18- to 30-year-olds, and an enterprise that Nelthorpe Cowne was dealing with. She calls Meghan ‘a really warm and genuine person’ who is ‘ferociously intelligent’ and who was ‘interested in humanitarian and philanthropic causes – and in animal rights issues too, but her main focus was and I believe still is, women’s rights. She wanted to be recognised as a humanitarian.’","The two worked closely together, and warmly, until September 2016 when ‘there was a big change. She did give me a difficult time.’ Meghan snapped at a young reporter: she complained about being asked to move seats in a first-class lounge to ‘make way for a group of male Colombian dignitaries.’ Nelthorpe Cowne got the feeling that, ‘it was as if this would be the last time anyone would ever ask her to move again.’ And that, roughly, was that: in October, Meghan wrote her ‘a lovely email, saying she was giving up her career and we had to terminate our contract.’ Remarkable to be so sure, just four months after she and Harry met. Not just made of tungsten, but possessed of a crystal ball as well.","Here on in, then, there are two eras. Love, love, love from the public – and the press – up to and including the wedding. Her half-sister, the nightmarish Samantha Markle was, and is, exactly that: a nightmare. Her father, Thomas, also didn’t cover himself in glory but... Why didn’t the palace take him in hand? Why wasn’t he showered with affection and inclusivity? What was, and is, going on? It’s strange not to have any member of your family at the wedding, bar Doria, your lovely and dignified mother – providing, by the by, an excellent PR opportunity for the Prince of Wales to conduct himself really, really well with Ms Ragland. (Speaking of awkward relatives: don’t forget that Kate Middleton still had her scapegrace Uncle Gary to her wedding.) It was clever, too, of the Archbishop of Canterbury to suggest the loquacious Bishop Michael Curry to give the address, and shrewd of Prince Charles to propose The Kingdom Choir for a rendition of ‘Stand By Me’. (Incidentally, the Archbishop met his Old Etonian chum, Matt Ridley, at Euston station the Wednesday before the wedding. How was he, asked Ridley. ‘I’ll be fine after Saturday,’ was the reply. ‘What’s happening on Saturday?’ asked Ridley, proving that not everyone was gripped by events.)","Read next","Prince Harry's life in pictures","As he becomes a father himself, we look back at our favourite red-haired prince's photo album","Ridley was among those at a lunch given that week by a national newspaper editor, at which the host shared his guesstimate about Meghan-Harry: after five years and two children, she’d take them to California to see their grandmother – and file for divorce. This wasn’t an uncommon topic. Great, obviously, to meet someone who adores you, but wouldn’t Meghan chafe? Fine to show up, as she did, in Roland Mouret to the concert for Sentebale, Harry’s HIV charity, and to sit near hedge funder Ian Wace; but how will a ‘ferociously intelligent’ woman pursue her more ‘controversial’ concerns? As simply a Suits star, she’d have been sure to diss Trump. As a royal, that’s verboten. Could she join the Women’s March? She’d want to, but anything plainly political is, again, out of the question for a royal. And Harry, for all his big-heartedness, is no intellectual.","She made a gesture of embracing Harry’s country side, but did it her way, going out on an aristo shoot in jeans and a jumper, toting a gun but not firing it – ‘didn’t care or try too hard,’ adds the source. ‘She also isn’t interested in being girlie/fluffy/having silly chats with the Sloanes. Separated herself a bit.’","The ‘separated herself a bit’ comment is telling. Harry is now less in with his old Gloucestershire set than he used to be. Although Skippy was invited to the couple’s wedding, alongside many of Harry’s old friends he was edged out of the reception at Frogmore House in favour of big celebrities. Both Harry and Meghan attended the Daisy Jenks-Charlie van Straubenzee wedding, but they also – eyebrow-raisingly – went to the three-day-long launch of Soho House Amsterdam. (Meghan, of course, held her hen party at Soho Farmhouse, near the couple’s cottage in Great Tew.)","The Amsterdam bash took place the weekend one of their wedding guests, Sophie Carter, married Robert Snuggs in Norfolk. William and Kate were there, Sophie being one of Princess Charlotte’s godparents. I don’t know which party I’d have preferred, but Soho House was definitely ‘new Harry’ – fan of the stars and aromatherapy devotee. Fun had already been had with the mixing of Goop/yoga-oriented Meghan with shots’n’wellies Harry. The Mail on Sunday ran an April Fool piece, claiming that his stag weekend was to include yurts, yoga, laverbread smoothies and predawn Celtic chanting in a blue stone circle in the Brecon Beacons. And lo, it has come to pass, as we know from Harry’s enthusing to a crowd in Birkenhead about the benefits of yoga.","Read next","Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall on their first royal visit to Cuba","The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall enjoy Buena Vista Social Club and vintage car shows in an attempt to woo the communist-run country","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabel Sampson","Kate probably does yoga, too. But that, it’s said, seems to be the limit of her and Meghan’s shared interests. Everyone ‘knows’ Kate was reduced to tears by Meghan’s brusqueness to her daughter, Charlotte. And everyone ‘knows’ that Harry upbraided William for what he felt was the Cambridges’ lukewarm embrace of Meghan. And everyone has their own views on whether the Cambridges did or did not have a prior engagement when Prince Charles invited them and the Sussexes to Scotland. And everyone’s got a mental image of the moment when Meghan will for the first time have to curtsey to Kate, when Kate becomes Queen, as protocol dictates. It’ll make having to wear nude stockings seem a breeze.","But Meghan’s glamour must be a hard pill for Kate to swallow, too. It’s not as though Kate and William were not in love when they married. But theirs had been a 10-year courtship, with ups, downs and even break-ups. So the remarkableness of Kate was... well, not entirely remarked on. She was, after all, a commoner, the first ever to marry a future King. (Edward VIII renounced the throne to marry the commoner and divorcee that Mrs Simpson was.) But Kate had learnt to play the royal game. Almost too well. She hasn’t put a foot wrong, but she has, in truth, played it safe. Not for Kate the likes of a £56,000 Ralph & Russo gown when she was photographed for Vogue; instead, she wore a £24 top from Petit Bateau. Not for her the expensive clothes that Meghan wears, perhaps paid for by Meghan, perhaps by the Prince of Wales. Which, indeed, leads one shrewd observer to ask, ‘Where’s the wonga going to come from when Charles is King? It’ll be William who’ll be handing out the Duchy money then. That’ll be interesting.’","It will. William wasn’t thrilled to be ticked off about his attitude towards Meghan. And Harry, some say, was not thrilled when William advised him against rushing into marriage. William’s a prickly character, and Harry’s hot-headed. And, as can be seen from his ‘what Meghan wants, Meghan gets’ outburst, he’ll fight his wife’s corner fiercely. Was the tiara at the centre of that tantrum already promised to Princess Eugenie for her wedding, as some believe? (Harry and Meghan, don’t forget, queue-barged their way into the first Windsor wedding of 2018.) And did the Queen veto Meghan’s plans for a sleeveless wedding dress? The rumours may be false, but not as false as the speculation Meghan was pregnant on her wedding day – ‘that’s why the dress was so baggy,’ one young woman assured me – and certainly not as false as the rumour that theirs is an IVF baby.","But it’s rumours like that, and the drip, drip, drip of stories about aides leaving Meghan’s employ and servants being upset by her manner, that are making their lives such a misery. The Prince of Wales’ enthusiasm for his daughter-in-law is being ignored, as is Meghan’s role as the catalyst for a new warmth between Harry and his father. People who’ve lunched with her have loved her; she’s beautiful; she’s clever; she’s made Harry happy. What’s not to like?","Advertisement","But are they happy as a couple? Harry’s circle has narrowed, and Meghan has shown how stung she’s been by letting her friends defend her in People magazine. George Clooney has stood up for her, invoking what happened to Diana, Princess of Wales as a warning. And it’s tough when her make-up chum, Daniel Martin, posts a picture of the tea she had laid out for him – avocado on toast, chocolates – and the line,  ‘Thank you Meghan for being the consummate hostess this weekend and still being the #avocadotoastwhisperer’, and posh noses sniff; it’s just not on, they say – what sort of person is she having around? Meghan wants a doula; cue mockery. Even though Britain has ten times more interracial relationships than the rest of Europe, according to a study quoted by Afua Hirsch, author of Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging, some of the antipathy must be racist, as it was of the biracial President Obama. Which is hard to stomach. Some of it is anti-American, in the mocking Gwyneth Paltrow dynamic-5am-email sense. Some of it is captured in the Daily Express headline ‘Loving... but dominating’. Some of it reflects sadness at the passing of the Jack the Lad Harry, the roguish Harry, the roistering Harry, in favour of a more sober, duller version.","And some of it is... some of it is the fact that people love a good gossip. Love to hear that the Clooneys, sitting next to John and Lady Carolyn Warren at the wedding, were bickering in the choir stalls. Love to think that there are duchessly handbags at dawn. Not nice at all if you’re the subject of it. And not nice when you’re pregnant in a foreign land, and not at all sure that royal insiders are on your side. Yes, it’s tricky, being Meghan Markle.","This piece was originally published in the May issue.","Share this article","Recommended","The best of the BAFTAs on Bystander: years of parties, after-parties and dinners","Featuring Lily James, Matt Smith, Ralph Fiennes and more","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Bystander","Travel","Luxury hotels celebrating milestone anniversaries in 2019","Decades of five-star experiences","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Elle Blakeman","Jewellery Month","Best jewellery moments of the year","Including highlights from the Oscars, Cannes and the MET ball","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Bystander","Royals","As the Queen marks 67 years on the throne, what does this year hold?","She's just shy of her Platinum Jubilee","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Victoria Murphy"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Data showed that whites produced an average of 680 kilograms of the CO2 each year, attributable to food and drink, whereas Latinx individuals produced 640 kilograms, and blacks 600.","They also found the diets of white people required 328,000 liters of water on average per year. Latinx used just 307,000 liters, and blacks 311,800. Both black and Latinx individuals used more land per capita with 1,770 and 1,710 square meters per year, respectively, than white people with just 1,550. Nevertheless, white people still made the greatest overall contribution to climate change.","“While the difference may not be enormous, these numbers are per individual, and when you add up all those individuals, it’s very clear that whites are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of their food choices,” says Bozeman.","Share this:","Share this article:","Share this:","Read Next","Woman gets preventive double mastectomy, learns DNA test w...","Read Next","Woman gets preventive double mastectomy, learns DNA test w...","Share Selection","Trending Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton NYPost.com","This story has been shared 36,540 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t36,540","This story has been shared 34,882 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t34,882","This story has been shared 26,038 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26,038","Now On\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow on Page Six","SEE ALL","Video","Warrant issued for suspect who hit man after asking if he was gay","Coupon Offers","45 Groupon discount codes","80% off bedding, furniture and more at Groupon","Booking.com coupon & promo code","Booking.com's Easter deal: 25%+ off vacations in Asia","Viator promo codes & coupons","Save $44 on Grand Canyon national park VIP tour at Viator","Travelocity coupon & coupon code","Las Vegas hotel and flight deals at Travelocity","26 Sightseeing Pass promo codes & offers","Sightseeing Pass promo code 20% off 2-10 day lasting Day Passes","See All Coupons","More Stories","page six","The internet cannot handle Jennifer Lopez's sexy bikini photo","nypost","The Yankees have a new Gary Sanchez problem","Post Digital Network","© 2019 NYP Holdings, Inc.

This site uses cookies to improve your experience and deliver personalised advertising. You can opt out at any time or find out more by reading our cookie policy.","By\n                                            Victoria Murphy","Baby Sussex has not even been born, but already he or she has filled more column inches, taken up more hours of air time, and generated more online clicks than almost all of us will throughout our lifetimes. This unprecedented level of worldwide interest in someone born seventh in line to the throne will, of course, only increase when the child arrives. And while he or she will be largely oblivious to their position for the first few years, teaching them how to manage the spotlight in the internet age will be just one of the things Harry and Meghan have to factor into their parenting.","Born into the world’s most famous royal family to parents who are two of its current stars, this child’s life is not set up to be “ordinary”. However, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do want to give their son or daughter the chance to experience life outside the royal bubble. This is all the more important because their descendants are not destined for a future filled with royal duties and will instead be expected to carve out their own careers. In the same way that Prince William’s cousins are not full-time working royals, any children Harry has will fall too far down the pecking order to have their lives mapped out with a royal role.","Advertisement","This relative freedom is likely to excite Harry and Meghan who I expect will want their child to be exposed to lots of different opportunities so they can choose for themselves where they want to focus their attention. Harry was sporty as a child before thriving in the army and has championed sport and the military in his charitable work. Former actress Meghan found her love of acting growing up and took part in school plays before deciding to study theatre and international relations at university. Telling staff at Bristol Old Vic Theatre in February she thought creative arts and theatre were “equally as important” as sport in schools, it seems clear that Meghan will encourage any creative streak her child has.","The duchess also developed a strong interest in gender equality from an early age, successfully campaigning age 11 to change a sexist TV commercial. Palace aides have dismissed claims she will bring her child up “gender fluid”, but Meghan has made it clear that she wants to pass on her belief in equality amongst the sexes. During a panel discussion on International Women’s Day, she said about a documentary she watched: “One of the things they said during pregnancy was I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism. I loved that. So boy or girl or whatever it is, we hope that that's the case with our little bump.\"","Read next","Meet Italian millionaire Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi: Princess Beatrice's new boyfriend","The Italian property tycoon who's swept the princess off her feet","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Having started their married life in what is often described as the “goldfish bowl” of west London’s Kensington Palace, the Sussexs hope to be in Windsor by the time their child is born. With Frogmore Cottage undergoing large-scale structural renovations at the taxpayers’ expense (the couple will pay for their own fixtures and fittings) it is expected that they will make the property their home for several years. The idyllic, rural spot is just 25 miles from their new offices at Buckingham Palace but offers a completely different lifestyle to the intensity of the capital. With the 5,000-acre Windsor Great Park on their doorstep the family can enjoy the outdoors while still being a stone’s throw from Windsor’s many shops and cafes. However, if they want to be certain of avoiding attention from the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the picturesque town every year, they may choose to spend their down time behind closed doors. Close friends George and Amal Clooney, who have toddler twins, have a house 30 minutes drive from Frogmore Cottage in Sonning, and longtime confidante Elton John and his husband David Furnish have a house on the edge of the Great Park. The Queen and Prince Philip spend many weekends and every Easter at Windsor Castle. Cousins George, Charlotte and baby Louis will be natural playmates although the move away from Kensington Palace means that the cousins won’t grow up constantly popping round to say hello.","Like William and Kate, Meghan and Harry want to play pivotal roles in their children’s lives rather than leave this to nannies. Meghan’s mum Doria, to whom she is very close and Harry has described as “amazing”, is expected to visit often and play a key role, although she will continue to live in Los Angeles. However, the couple will almost certainly get professional help, especially once they both resume royal duties. As well as potential nannies they may also choose to follow the Cambridges’ decision to send their child to a local nursery and will eventually have the pick of Windsor’s top schools.","Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie grew up in Windsor and both went to Upton House school, which takes girls and boys into the nursery from age two, followed by Coworth Park then St George’s School. Harry’s old primary Ludgrove, which he attended from age eight, is a 30-minute drive away. His secondary school, Eton, is even closer at just a 20-minute walk from Windsor Castle. However, just as William and Kate have not chosen William’s old primary school for George, Harry and Meghan may also opt for somewhere completely different.","Even the future king is just called George by his teachers and classmates, and baby Sussex is sure to follow suit and be treated like everyone else in the classroom. What his or her title will be outside that is still to be determined. King George V limited titles within the royal family in 1917 meaning that the option of an HRH Prince or Princess would only be on the table if The Queen steps in and issues a Letters Patent. If Harry and Meghan don’t want this, as the eldest son of a duke, a boy would inherit one of his father’s subsidiary titles and be called Earl of Dumbarton. A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor and any subsequent sons would be Lord (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.","Advertisement","Such things will be largely irrelevant when it comes to what sort of life this child will lead. It goes without saying that he or she will almost certainly never want for anything material. However, Harry and Megan - who was once a jobbing actress working to make ends meet - will be keen to make sure that their child is not spoiled or entitled.","It is pretty much impossible that this baby can ever inherit the throne - for example Prince Michael of Kent was born seventh in line and now at age 76 will become 48th after the birth of baby Sussex. That said, the sons of Princess Diana grew up side by side in the full - and equal - glare of the spotlight, meaning that the interest in Harry gives this family a unique place in the hearts and minds of many around the world. The fascination with the Sussexs could lessen significantly as time passes, with the focus shifting towards George, Charlotte and Louis as the future of the monarchy. Yet, with celebrity culture existing around the world like never before and the internet and social media making falling out of the spotlight almost impossible, it could be the case that the Sussex family’s prominence never really fades.","The path that this baby’s life will take is not pre-determined. The huge interest in the road ahead for him or her most certainly is.","Share this article","Recommended","Royals","Royal baby name predictions for Baby Sussex","From traditional monikers like Victoria and James, to wildcard choices like Amelia and Spencer","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Rebecca Cope","Duchess of Sussex","The Duchess of Sussex is pregnant","There's a new royal baby on the way","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Tatler","Royals","What life was really like on-board Royal Yacht Britannia","Water fights, Carry-On-style sketches, afternoon tea and more","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Travel","A royal guide to Morocco","What the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should be ticking off their to-do list...","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Ashley Pearson"],"targetCaptions":[]}

But in a new cover story from The Hollywood Reporter, the “Captain America” star said he “might have to cut ties” with Tom Brady if the Patriots quarterback still supports President Donald Trump.","In the past, Evans has given Brady a bit of a pass on his political views. In a 2017 interview, the Sudbury native said that he didn’t want to “encourage this landscape of if you disagree with me politically, you’re my enemy,” and that he was giving Brady a pass because “he gave me five rings.” But when asked by THR just prior to Super Bowl 52 if he would ever consider playing Brady in a movie, Evans expressed reservations.","“I don’t know,” Evans said. “I really hope he’s not a Trump supporter. I’m just hoping he’s one of those guys that maybe supported him and now regrets it. Maybe he thought it was going to be different — and even that bothers me — but maybe there’s a chance now he just thinks Trump’s an absolute dumb s***, which he is. If he doesn’t, if he’s still on that Trump train, I might have to cut ties. It’s really tough.”","Evans has been frequently critical of Trump on Twitter, and it doesn’t seem like he will be shying away from politics anytime soon. The actor recently met with a number of politicians in Washington, D.C.; THR revealed that Evans was interviewing them for a new politics website that he co-founded, called A Starting Point, which aims to “create informed, responsible and empathetic citizens.”","“You don’t want to alienate half your audience,” Evans said, regarding his political tweets. “But I’d be disappointed in myself if I didn’t speak up. Especially for fear of some monetary repercussion or career damage — that just feels really gross to me.”","©2019 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Hayner | @ChrisHayner on March 29, 2019 at 7:21AM PDT","The golden age of Saturday morning cartoons is an era that will always live on in our memories. After all, who didn't sit down with a bowl of cereal to follow the newest adventures of GI Joe, Transformers, or any number of other series to kick off their weekend as kids?","Here's something you might not have realized, though. As it turns out, way too many of those amazing cartoons were created as nothing more than marketing tools for toys. Some of the shows made perfect sense, as action-based toy lines left plenty of room for stories to be told. Others, however, had to reach pretty far to work a storyline into what was otherwise a pretty basic and story-free line of toys.","Take a look at our favorite toy-based cartoons below, then sound off with the ones you loved in the comments. And when you're done, make sure to check out our look at cartoons based movies. You might be surprised at some of the very adult movies that got a kid-friendly adaptation.","Share this Gallery","Latest Image Galleries","WonderCon 2019 Cosplay Day Two: Dark Helmet, Pickle Rick, And More","Avengers Endgame Funko Pops Are Here, Check All 20 Of Them Out","Avengers Endgame: What The New Lego Sets Tell Us About The Movie","1. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe","He-Man's cartoon is an interesting one because the toy it's based on was made simply to try to cash in on the Star Wars craze. One part space warrior and another part Conan the Barbarian, He-Man got comics before he became a cartoon, but once the franchise was animated, it became wildly popular and even spawned the She-Ra spin-off and a Christmas special.","2. Hot Wheels","Everyone knows the most exciting thing about the Hot Wheels toy line was the people driving the cars, right? Nope. The animated series, which only managed to squeak out 17 episodes, followed a high school student that started his own racing club. It was bad, but it's also one of the first toy-based cartoons. Hot Wheels premiered in 1969 and had complaints lodged against it with the FCC that it was nothing more than a half-hour commercial, which… it was.","3. Pound Puppies","Pound Puppies were the saving grace of kids who didn't have actual dogs. The toy line was simple, it was a bunch of stuffed dogs that kids would \"adopt.\" The show, which ran for two seasons between 1986 and 1987, gave a bunch of the dogs personalities and somehow makes the dog pound seem like a cool place for animals.","4. Jem","It's rock and roll Barbie, which is kind of a perfect toy idea. It was only a matter of time before it got turned into a cartoon, which is when the Jem franchise caught fire in a truly outrageous way---truly, truly, truly outrageous. The Jem cartoon ran for three seasons in the '80s, and a 2017 live-action movie was even released, though it was met with bad reviews and a short, disastrous box office run.","5. Mighty Max","The Mighty Max line of toys itself was a spin-off of Polly Pocket. Each variation was a tiny pocket-sized playset that would put the titular character in all kinds of danger. The cartoon, however, features the aforementioned Mighty Max as a kid with a magical baseball cap that allows him to teleport through space and time as he fights against the Skullmaster, an ancient evil being. It's a pretty wild concept, even for a cartoon from 1993, and it lasted 40 episodes.","6. Captain N: The Game Masters","The Nintendo Entertainment System counts as a toy, right? Of course it does! Captain N was the coolest and convinced many of us that carrying around a Zapper from the NES in a holster was perfectly normal. The series featured characters from a number of Nintendo games, including Castlevania, Mega Man, Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda. If that's not exciting for you, I'm not sure what to say.","7. Sky Commanders","Sky Commanders was a very cool toy that led to a less-than-cool cartoon. The toy was essentially an action figure that traveled across strings you'd hang up throughout your bedroom. It was messy, but so much fun. The animated series saw ongoing battles between good and evil mountaineers facing off on a new continent. Like many cartoons of the era, it was a lot of gibberish. However, it took a relatively simple and very fun toy idea and made it simply too complex.","8. The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin","What's strange about this particular animated series is that Teddy Ruxpin was essentially an animatronic tape player. There wasn't a lot of playing to be done with this toy. Instead, you watched its mouth move while a cassette played. The cartoon, however, is a lot more intense. Teddy and his friend--an octopede named Grubby--leave their home in search of treasure before coming up against an evil group known as the Monsters and Villains Organization--in case you were wondering if they should be trusted--also searching for a magical treasure they want to use to rule the world. Teddy, sadly, was not powered by cassette tapes in this wildly convoluted show.","9. GI Joe: The Real American Hero","GI Joe is, perhaps, the second most successful cartoon adaptation of a toy. The line of soldier toys have spawned six animated series, two movies, comic books, and continue to be a household name to this day. What's more, all of that is possible due to the original 1985 cartoon, which helped to drive the toy's popularity.","10. Care Bears","If you were a child of the '80s, chances are you spent some time trying to perfect the Care Bear Stare. What's interesting about the Care Bears, though, is that while the cartoon--and movies that followed--were based on the popular plush toys from the early '80s, the entire franchise actually started as a line of greeting cards.","11. Creepy Crawlers","It's a cartoon based on a toy that's sort of like an Easy Bake Oven, but for rubber bugs you should never eat. If you had a Creepy Crawlers toy, chances are you made gross-looking bugs for about a week then lost interest because it does literally nothing else. However, the cartoon actually got 23 episodes and was about a kid who wanted to be a magician that created creepy bug-like mutant creatures. Oddly enough, the animated series got its own line of action figures. Thus, they were toys based on a cartoon based on a toy.","12. Dino-Riders","Dino-Riders is the perfect concept of both an '80s action toy and an exciting Saturday morning cartoon. Two warring alien races crash on Earth during prehistoric times and equip dinosaurs with all manner of weaponry to continue their battle. The possibilities for toy varieties were endless and the animated series--which somehow only lasted 14 episodes--was fantastic.","13. Dungeons & Dragons","Turning an RPG game like Dungeons & Dragons into an animated series seems like an easy choice. Simply adapt one of the games stories for kids. Instead, the D&D cartoon is about a group of kids that get sucked into the world of the game after taking a ride on a magical rollercoaster. They then spend the rest of the series trying to get home, you know, because they're children stuck in a horrifying world. And, of course, the series ended before they actually had the chance to escape. So, in theory, they all probably died stuck in whatever realm they landed in.","14. Challenge of the GoBots","GoBots! They're like Transformers but way less exciting. Honestly, the two toy lines are so alike, down to them being warring factions from a distant fictional planet. However, while GoBots lasted an impressive 65 episodes, it was always seen as the second-rate Transformers knockoff. Of course, that's until Hasbro bought the property and incorporated it into the Transformers canon.","15. My Little Pony","This might come as a surprise but the My Little Pony animated series and theatrical movie didn't debut until 1986, four years after the launch of the toyline. Prior to that, there were two syndicated half-hour specials set in the world of the toy.","16. M.A.S.K.","M.A.S.K.--short for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand--was a weird mix of GI Joe and Transformers. But if you're going to copy two things, copy two of the best! The toys and animated series featured an elite task force drove special vehicles that transformed into battle tanks, fighter jets, and the like to fight against an enemy called V.E.N.O.M., which totally isn't a riff on GI Joe's Cobra at all.","17. Ring Raiders","Do you even remember Ring Raiders? They were essentially the Micro Machines version of airplanes, mounted to plastic rings, and they were awesome. As much fun as the toys were, though, the cartoon is a bit baffling. It was, naturally, about a group of special fighter pilots. To work the rings into the lore, though, each pilot wore one that could call the fellow Ring Raiders. It lasted five episodes.","18. Popples","Honestly, Popples more-or-less looked like neon teddy bears. In the series, several of them were given personalities and a human family they lived with. Unlike many cartoons of the time, the Popples series wasn't about going to mystic lands or searching for treasure. Instead, the kids simply tried to keep their parents from finding out the Popples were real. The series was able to sustain that for 41 episodes--plus three more that never aired.","19. Street Sharks","The '80s and '90s were a strange time where mutant animal warriors reigned supreme. Whether it was the Ninja Turtles, Biker Mice from Mars, or Street Sharks, somewhere there was a normal animal turned into a human-like beast out there defeating evil. Of those three, though, Street Sharks was the only one that was a toy first.","It gave the bizarre toys an even more bizarre backstory about an evil scientist genetically modifying four brothers to turn them into humanoid sharks. From there, the brothers attempt to stop him from doing further heinous deeds, while also doing battle against a wide range of even creepier creations he's come up with, like a mutant lobster with the DNA of Genghis Khan for some reason. Street Sharks is super weird.","20. Transformers","It's hard to argue that Transformers is the king of this particular mountain. The vehicles that transform into robot warriors were all the rage in the '80s and the animated series that launched in 1984 spun off into a long list of cartoons, animated movies and, now, six live-action films. Talk about more than meets the eye."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Poorly received by critics and a flop at the box office, Justice League endured a troubled production that saw Joss Whedon brought in for rewrites before ultimately serving as director for the extensive reshoots the film underwent after Snyder stepped away.","Whedon reportedly reshot somewhere between 15-20%of the film in order to lighten the tone and shorten the runtime, the latter of which was mandated by Warner Bros.' then-CEO, Kevin Tsujihara. This represented a significant departure from previous films within the DC Extended Universe, most notably those directed by Snyder, which were considerably darker in tone and featured runtimes eclipsing 140 minutes.","RELATED: Justice League Photographer Casts Doubt on 'Snyder Cut'","Most critical of the theatrical cut of Justice League were die-hard Snyder fans, who felt they were robbed of the culmination of the director's vision for the DC Extended Universe launched by 2013's Man of Steel. In the days following the release of the ensemble film, a petition demanding the release of the Snyder Cut was launched and went on to be signed by nearly 180,000 people. The petition was based on the premise that the disappointing critical response to the film and its poor showing at the box office should be attributed to Whedon's directing, largely pointing to his use of humor, as well as Wthe decision to cut the runtime down to two hours.","Die-hard Snyder fans have been vocal in their demand for the Snyder Cut to be released by Warner Bros. despite denials that it even exists from the film studio. Some close to Snyder, including DC storyboard artist Jay Oliva, countered the denials claiming that Snyder had shot all the planned scenes for his version of the film and had assembled a rough, unpolished cut of the film prior to stepping away, which has likely aided in the continued demand for the Snyder Cut over 16 months after the film's release.","Zack Snyder has remained relatively quiet on the existence of the Snyder Cut, leaking some details from his vision for the film and thanking fans for their support, but never confirming the existence of a finished cut of the film. That, however, has seemingly changed following a Director's Cut Event he hosted in California over the weekend, which involved screenings of three of his previous director's cuts and panels featuring special guests from the casts and crews of the movies showcased.","RELATED: Darkseid Was Going to Kill Lois Lane in Zack Snyder's Justice League","An attendee of the event posted a photo of him shaking Snyder's hand, accompanied by the claim that he asked the director face to face about the Snyder Cut, which Snyder then confirmed to exist. \"Even though I wasn't able to ask my question during the Q&A I did get the chance to ask Zack face to face about the Snyder cut,\" the attendee wrote. \"He said 'the movie is done, it exists' but basically it is up to WB. He is not aware that WB has any plans to release. Bittersweet #ReleaseTheSnyderCut.\"","The user later posted a video of the director confirming that the Snyder Cut is a real thing to another attendee. The user also utilized his interaction with Snyder to urge fans to \"ramp up the pressure\" on Warner Bros. to release the Snyder cut.","There is a video floating around now where someone actually filmed him saying it is done. If this is not enough evidence that the Snyder Cut exists and IS DONE, then I can't help you. Major credit to @Woke_master for capturing this on video. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut pic.twitter.com/CY9xOmfSkx","However, another fan who attended the event, tweeted that Snyder revealed there are a number of different cuts, and that he would need to finish the film before it could be released, if ever. \"Zack told me that he doesn’t know because [WB] owns the movie,\" the user wrote. \"And there is actually 10 different cuts. And that he would have to finish it.\"","So it seems that a Snyder Cut (or several) may actually exist, or, rather, it could exist if Snyder was given the opportunity to finish it by Warner Bros. This isn't a likely development, of course, given the studio has already demonstrated they have little to no interest in releasing a Snyder Cut, or any further alternate versions of Justice League for that matter. And why would it?","RELATED: Zack Snyder Says His Justice League Plans Were 'Better' Than Flashpoint","The studio reportedly lost $60 million on Justice League's theatrical release, and releasing a Snyder Cut now doesn't make any sense. It would be a move that's counterproductive to the current upward trend that the DCEU is currently on. The studio had its first billion dollar film last year in James Wan's Aquaman, and David F. Sandberg's Shazam! has earned early acclaim from critics as the film is heading toward its opening weekend with reactions matching Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman with a DCEU high Rotten Tomatoes score of 93% of this writing. Both films have demonstrated a marked departure from the tonality of the early Snyder-led DCEU films, and have found or seem destined to find success in doing so.","With Justice League in its rear-view mirror, Warner Bros. is reportedly focusing more on self-contained films instead of an intricately plotted shared universe, and its easy to see why. The most successful films, both critically and commercially, within the DCEU have been standalone films, first with Wonder Woman and then Aquaman. Shazam! appears to be continuing that trend. There is, frankly, little incentive for the studio to look back when the future of its DC franchise is so much brighter than it ever has been.","Unfortunately for die-hard Snyder fans, this means the Snyder Cut will likely never more than a pipe dream -- whether it exists or not.","Tags:\nfeature,\njustice league (film)","Leave A Comment","More in CBR Exclusives","Jordan Peele May Be This Generation's Alfred Hitchcock","Review: Dumbo Is Disney's Most Original Live-Action Remake Yet","Captain Marvel Is Already the MCU's 10th-Highest Grossing Film in the US","Us Could Be Universal's Solution to Its Dark Universe Problem","Arrow Just Upended Black Siren's Precarious Status Quo","Will Big Bang Theory Finally Fix Its Longest-Running Problem?","The Avengers Just Can't Quit the Hulk!","Spider-Man Meme: The Most Hilarious (And Disturbing) '60s Spidey Memes","Marvel's Avengers Have Recruited a New Four-Legged Member","REVIEW: Heroes in Crisis Digs Its Hooks in Deeper With Issue 7","The Heroverse Comes Calling in Dial H for Hero #1","Detective Comics #1000 is a Wonderful Celebration of Batman's Legacy","Spider-Man: Life Story #1 is a Wonderful Idea Marred by Bland Execution","REVIEW: Batman #67 is Not Going to Be for Everyone","Spider-Man: City at War #1 (Too) Faithfully Adapts Sony's Hit Video Game","PREVIEW: Heroes in Crisis #7","PREVIEW: Dial H For Hero #1","PREVIEW: Detective Comics #1000","Hit-Girl Season Two #3","Trending Now","EXCL: Amanda Waller Learns Another Superman Secret in Action Comics #1009","Arrow Rewrites Its Own History With Shocking Emiko Revelation","Humphries & Quinones Explore DC's Secret History in Dial H for Hero","CBR.com values your privacy.

You’ll see. You’ll see.”","My husband is the reason we have a record player in the first place, and the only reason we have albums by the likes of Fleetwood Mac, Miles Davis, and the Beach Boys. At this point, my contributions to our vinyl collection had been 2Pac’s All Eyes on Me and Rihanna’s Anti. My taste in music is pretty much either: What the cool kids were listening to back in middle school, or contemporary Top 40.","You see, I am exactly the kind of person who buys Jagged Little Pill on vinyl, and I am exactly the kind of person who buys records via Amazon Prime. (This Venn diagram overlaps completely.)","When that square-shaped Amazon package arrived one afternoon, I ripped it open and put it on immediately, feeling the thrill of nostalgic anticipation. This was more than two decades after I first listened to the album as a 12-year-old. I’d purchased the CD—at a Tower Records, no doubt—after seeing Alanis on MTV angrily stomping around in the desert for the “You Oughta Know” music video. I remember the shock of recognition at her long-ass tangly hair and spastic movements. She was a weird, dirty, uncontainable girl just like me.","Advertisement","That song channeled all of my simmering rage—at dickhead little boys, at puberty’s onslaught, and at the suffocating wave of feminine expectation about to wash right over me.","Needless to say, I was now, as I slipped the vinyl out of its sleeve, in a different era and life phase.  I had long ago made it through puberty (although my simmering rage at feminine expectation continued). I was no longer listening on my beat-up Sony Discman, but rather a nostalgically reengineered record player. I had just picked up my toddler from daycare and was becoming the cliche parent imposing youthful cultural artifacts upon her offspring.","As soon as the trippy guitar and harmonica of “All I Really Want” kicked in, my toddler started dancing in stomping circles, and I felt briefly vindicated. “See! You already like it,” I exclaimed to this little human whose favorite song is “Baby Shark.” If I was honest, though, the bing-bing-bing of the electric guitar, the wobbly affectation of her voice, and the feeble lyrics (“Enough about me, let’s talk about you for a minute/Enough about you, let’s talk about life for a while”) had planted a seed of doubt.","Advertisement","Next was “You Oughta Know,” with its halting, haunting opening: “I. Want. You. To. Know. I’m. Hap-py. For. You.” When the electric guitar picked up and she wailed her, “You, you, you oughta know-ohh,” I cringed a little bit. What had once felt enlivening and validating now felt grating and corny. That electric guitar kept on clanging. Are electric guitars usually so... electric? I was finding it hard to think. Hard to be. Hard to exist. In the same room. As this music.","I turned down the volume. Then I checked the RPM on the record player, which my son often tweaks to humorous effect, but all was as it should be. AND YET IT WAS NOT. NOT AT ALL. Where was the album that I had loved so dearly and deeply?","When “Perfect,” a plain, earnest song about the pressure to be “good enough,” came on, I had a realization: Jagged Little Pill was “Baby Shark” for mid-’90s angsty tween girls. It spoke in the simplest language, literally and musically, to that particular psychological stage of development at that particular cultural moment. She was every bit the flip-sides of tender earnestness and fuck-you anger that is so quintessentially middle school. The song begins alongside some light guitar: “Sometimes is never quite enough/If you’re flawless, then you’ll win my love/Don’t forget to win first place/Don’t forget to keep that smile on your face.”","Advertisement","These are not profound lyrics. They are not timeless. But holy fuck did they speak to my sense of not being nearly good enough—according to boys, according to Seventeen, according to MTV spring break specials. Alanis was angry and unruly about not being good enough. She huffed real hard into her harmonica about it and filled me with “You go girl” feeling. The same was true with “I See Right Through You.” I saw right through-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh the bullshit, too! (Side-note, for another day: Can we talk about the lyrics, “You took a long hard look at my ass and then played golf for a while”?)","It wasn’t even “Ironic,” and its infamous misuse of the word, that ultimately broke me. It was these lyrics: “You live/You learn/You love/You learn/You cry/You learn/You lose/You learn/You bleed/You learn/You scream/You learn.” I screamed. Oh did I. And then I texted my husband a mea culpa: “Jagged Little Pill is actually Very Bad.”","This feels like apostasy. Alanis has lived in my head for the past two decades as the artful embodiment of a powerful, unruly, inspiringly angry woman. The same year that I first listened to Jagged Little Pill, my dad took me to see her perform at the Greek Theater in Berkeley. We stood in the mosh pit, where plaid-wearing, twenty-something Cal students openly smoked pot, looking extremely impressed with themselves. Afterward, as the crowd poured out onto the street, Alanis’s white limo went driving by and I ran after her, screaming, as she lifted a single hand through the moon roof and waved (right at me, I was pretty sure).","Advertisement","She was a statement of possibility for my 12-year-old self, and for many other girls and women at the time. The album’s been called “a powerful, DIY feminist statement.” Some have asked whether it’s “the most feminist album of the ‘90s.” She was, as Allison Yarrow has argued, part of a crop of that era’s women rockers, including Fiona Apple and Meredith Brooks, who represented a commercialization of Riot Grrrl rage. The nostalgia for Jagged Little Pill is such that it’s soon to become a Broadway musical. This makes both Alanis and the album, which she co-wrote and recorded at the young age of 19, culturally significant—but it doesn’t make it good, timeless music.","And, needless to say, it doesn’t mean buy it on vinyl.","Share This Story","Related Stories","The Jagged Little Pill Musical Written By Diablo Cody Is Heading to Broadway","Alanis Morissette's Ex-Manager Admits to Embezzling $4.8 Million From Her","Alanis Morissette Had a Baby, Named Her Onyx Solace","About the author","Senior Staff Writer, Jezebel","You may also like","How to Access the 'Snake' Easter Egg in Google Maps","5 Mysteries Surrounding the Life and Death of Dr. Sebi","It's a Cold Day in Hell on The Walking Dead Season Finale","Recent from Tracy Clark-Flory","Florida Lawmaker to Sex Workers:  They're Criminals, I Don't Need to Listen","'I Was Not Warned': Patients Push FDA to Ban Cancer-Linked Breast Implants","The Porn Industry Is Rethinking How It Works With HIV Positive Performers"],"targetCaptions":[]}

In the video above, GameSpot video producer Jean-Luc Seipke and associate editor Jordan Ramée voice their impressions of the new trailer after watching it.","Fans of the original Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, and Tales from the Borderlands: A Telltale Series, both Jean-Luc and Jordan are happy to see several beloved characters return in the trailer for the new game. Most notable is an adult Tiny Tina, who was still 13-years-old in Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, but the return of characters from Tales from the Borderlands is a welcome surprise. There are plenty of other familiar faces as well, such as Sirens Lilith and Maya (the latter of whom is now sporting longer hair), Ellie, Marcus, and Sir Hammerlock.","Although the sight of so many beloved Borderlands characters is nice, both Jean-Luc and Jordan are wary of just how little the Borderlands 3 trailer touches on the franchise's strongest points. The characters' hilariously ludicrous dialogue is absent, and there's little individuality in regards to the new heroes and villains. Jean-Luc and Jordan are also a little worried that the environments in the trailer all look a little too much like Pandora. If Borderlands 3 takes place on multiple worlds--as Borderlands 2 implied and the new trailer claims--then the people and places in this new game should be fairly different from what's been seen before.","Obviously, with this being the very first look at Borderlands 3, neither Jean-Luc or Jordan are ready to condemn or praise the game--especially not before they can get their hands on it. As is, after watching this trailer, they are optimistic Borderlands 3 can carve out its own identity in the now loot shooter heavy market.","Borderlands 3's announcement was accompanied by the reveal of an enhanced Borderlands GOTY Edition coming to Xbox One, PS4, and PC. A free update is also being released that adds 4K graphics to Borderlands: The Handsome Collection--a bundle of Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel--which is also available on Xbox One, PS4, and PC.","Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The two other Toledo-area pastors charged in the investigation have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.","Prosecutors said during the opening of Haynes' trial that he first had sex with the girl when she was 14. They said the evidence against him includes text messages, photos, voice mails and DNA evidence from his church where the girl said they often had sex.","Haynes' attorney told jurors that the allegations are shocking, but there's not enough evidence to prove the trafficking and conspiracy charges he faces.","Attorney Pete Wagner also said Haynes may have had a questionable relationship with the girl, but he didn't coordinate or take part in trafficking her to the other ministers. He also said there was no paying for sex.","Prosecutors say the girl had a difficult childhood and was sexually abused by a relative.","Haynes pledged in front of his congregation to protect her and serve as a father figure, but he began grooming her for sex when she turned 14 and first forced her to perform sex acts in front of him, said Michael Freeman, an assistant U.S. attorney.","They had sex day after day, often at a motel or his church, the Greater Life Christian Center in Toledo, and Haynes would give her cash, Freeman said.","After about a year, Haynes introduced her to Kenneth Butler, another pastor, and he also began having sex with her, Freeman said.","Sometimes, the two men joked about the arrangement, prosecutors said. One text shown in court that prosecutors say was sent by Butler to the girl said: \"You better be nice and naked when I get there.\"","Prosecutors said the girl next met Cordell Jenkins, a minister who founded his own church in Toledo and built a large following until it closed after his arrest.","The FBI has said in court documents that Jenkins had sex with two girls at his home, church office and a motel and often recorded the acts with his phone.","Haynes, prosecutors said, encouraged the relationship with Jenkins.","In addition to the charges against the men, Haynes' wife and stepdaughter are accused of abducting the girl at gunpoint in January and warning her not to testify at his trial.","Court documents say the pair forced the teenager from her apartment, choked her with a cord and told her to take back statements she made to investigators. Attorneys for Haynes' wife and stepdaughter have declined to comment.","Just before her husband went on trial, his wife appeared Monday in the same courtroom where the judge overseeing the case turned down her request to be released.","Sign up for instant alerts from MySA by texting NEWS to 77453.","Sign up for instant alerts from MySA by texting NEWS to 77453.","Most Popular","Tejano singer Selena killed in a Corpus motel","U.S. Marshal arrested for drug possession at a San Antonio strip club","3 sisters, 1 friend killed in Central Texas traffic accident","Woman found dead in a Northwest Side apartment Sunday","SAFD: Burglar bars hinder firefighters in fatal blaze Sunday on the Northwest Side","Bravo announces S.A.-based reality show","L.A. rapper reportedly dead at 33 after Hyde Park shooting","Spurs clinch playoff berth, match NBA record from their couches","Alligators dropped to darkest Gulf depths to see what bites","21 years ago: The Selena movie cast then & now","Vintage photos show tragedies, everyday life in San Antonio in 1979","Tila Tequila, er, Tornado Thien, has started a GoFundMe to record a gospel album","Hours-long SWAT standoff ends in arrest at near-North Side home","Attorney: NBA star Kristaps Porzingis is accused of rape","Truck crash spills 42,000 pounds of avocados into South Llano River","About","Contact","Connect","Subscribe"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Superman: Dawn of Justice came to be.","RELATED: Justice League Photographer Casts Doubt on 'Snyder Cut'","\"The truth is that the 'Knightmare Sequence' in this movie, it was my idea that all of that would eventually be explained - is that a surprise?,\" the director said. \"And that we would end up in the distant future where Darkseid has taken over Earth, and where Superman has succumbed to the Anti-Life [Equation]. And there were a few members of the Justice League that survived to that world, and that they were fighting, Batman and a broken half of Cyborg - there's only half of him because of whatever happened - they were working on an equation to jump back to tell Bruce... those were the things that we were dealing with. And the studio, they were still sort of into the big look, but the deep depth about how and why everyone was mad at each other...\"","As Snyder continued, he revealed that the Flash's warning to Bruce Wayne about Lois Lane being the key was central to this future. \"Because Lois - and it's in the Justice League teaser; it wasn't in the movie apparently... it's this line where Bruce says, 'I was right here, and Barry Allen came to me and he said 'Lois Lane is the key.' And then [Wonder Woman] goes, 'She is to Superman; every heart has one.' And he goes, 'I think it's something more, something darker.' And what it means is that the thing that was darker was all about if Lois died, Superman would succumb to the Anti-Life, right? And Superman knew that somehow it was Bruce's responsibility to protect Lois, he would've been mad at him in this movie, and that's why he says, 'She was my world, and you took her from me.\"","But what, exactly, happened to the intrepid reporter? Well, according to Snyder, she would have fallen at the hands of the DC Universe's big bad. \"Because he [Bruce] had to jump back right before Darkseid Boom Tubes into the Batcave to murder Lois.\"","Of course, with Warner Bros. bringing in Joss Whedon to re-shoot and retool Justice League, the final film was far from Snyder's original vision. Since a Snyder Cut of the film is unlikely to ever be released, the director's answers may be all that fans will ever get to bring closure to this Batman v. Superman plot thread.","RELATED: Justice League Concept Art Reveals Unused Apokolips Creature","Next up for Warner Bros. is David F.

But you may not know quite how networks function, thus enter our modem versus router comparison.","Both are necessary components for wired and wireless internet access in your home. Understanding the difference between the two can help you diagnose and possibly fix networking problems before placing time-consuming calls with technical support.","We provide an explanation of each and illustrate how and why each device is important. We also explain a new alternative to using the standard router if you’re considering an upgrade to your current home network setup.","Modem","The modem is your on-ramp to the world wide web. Once the internet grew to become a mainstream household product in the early 1990s, modems became add-in cards for desktops and USB adapters for laptops. Cable-based broadband producing speeds faster than 56Kbps seemingly reintroduced the external modem at the beginning of the century, thus here we are today.","Right now, Xfinity from Comcast is the largest cable provider in the United States, covering 40 states. That is followed by Charter Spectrum, covering 43 states.  These broadband providers “rent” modems as part of their subscription plans so you can access their subscription-based service. But you can purchase compatible modems separately from any retailer to cut down on the monthly cost. Either way, you’ll need one to access the internet.","How it works","Modems usually include lights/LEDs along their front, so you can see what’s going on at a glance. One light indicates that the unit is receiving power, one signals that its receiving data from your internet service provider and one shows that the modem is successfully sending data. This is where you start in a troubleshooting scenario: If the send and/or receive lights are blinking, then your internet service provider is likely having issues or something is going on with the connection outside. Another LED is provided indicating that wired devices are accessing the internet.","Before we move on, note that modems aren’t just for a coaxial cable connection. Broadband can be served up through a Digital Subscriber Line too, or DSL. This internet on-ramp is accessed through telephone lines instead of coaxial cables, so the connecting jack looks no different than what you would see on physical, land-based phones. DSL is typically slower than cable-based broadband and useful in rural areas where phone lines already exist, but there’s no infrastructure supporting cable-based TV and internet services.","Whether the router is designed for DSL or cable-based broadband, the four Ethernet ports are used for wired devices with a matching port or adapter. These can include desktops, laptops, HDTVs, gaming consoles, printers, and more. If you want the most out of your broadband connection, using these ports for your hardware is the best option, especially if the ports support speeds of up to one gigabit per second (aka gigabit Ethernet).","Router","But not everyone wants to line Ethernet cables all over their house, and that’s where the router comes in. It’s a stand-alone device that connects to an Ethernet port on the modem, and “routes” networking/internet traffic to its connected devices. Routers typically have a dedicated, color-coded Ethernet port that it uses to physically connect to the router (WAN, or Wide Area Network), and four additional Ethernet ports for wired devices (LAN or Local Area Network).","Thus, the router sends and receives networking traffic from the modem with one connection, and routes all that data through its four Ethernet ports, and through the air via the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Despite advertised numbers, wired is faster than wireless, and we still suggest using Ethernet if you want every ounce of bandwidth out of your subscription. But obviously you can’t do that with smartphones, and draping Ethernet cables along every wall is just downright ugly.","Unfortunately, routers come in all sizes, prices, and exaggerated promises. On the wireless side, they can include two external antennas or more, depending on the model. The more antennas they have protruding in the air like a dead spider’s legs, the higher the prices will soar. Of course, the added antennas mean increased range, but your connection speed will depend on your proximity to the router, and the technology powering that connection.","The current wireless standard is Wireless AC. Its first implementation enables three outgoing streams and three incoming streams (3×3) on the 5GHz band at up to 433Mbps each. They’re accompanied by three incoming and three outgoing Wireless N streams (3×3) on the 2.4GHz band at 200Mbps each. The latest update to the Wireless AC specification, aka Wave-2, adds a fourth stream for additional bandwidth. Problem is, smartphones typically only support between one (1×1) or two (2×2) incoming/outgoing streams, so they can’t get the full benefits of routers supporting 3×3 broadcasts.","How it works","If all of this is confusing, just imagine a high-speed train. It enters your home through the modem, travels to the train station (router) at full speed, and is redirected to a destination. If the destination is a wired connection, then it plows full speed ahead. If the destination is wireless, it’s speed is based on how many tracks/streams it can use at once (one, two, three, or four), the amount of congestion these tracks must penetrate, and the distance between the train station and the destination. The train will lose speed the further it travels away from the station.","The “up to” term means the hardware is physically capable of supporting those maximum speeds, but again you won’t see them. Part of the “congestion” slowing your local data train is your neighbor’s network spreading the love in the same airspace. There’s also interference from devices within and outside your home. Having a router with multiple, external antennas with amplifiers will help push back all that unwanted noise.","Typically, routers will choose the ideal channel for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands that have the least interference. The 2.4GHz band is divided into 14 channels while more than 20 are set aside for the 5GHz band. But if you’re having connectivity issues, manually changing the channels within the router’s web-based interface can sometimes help. There’s a lot more at play regarding speed that gets into the heavy technical territory and can make your head spin.","Check out our list of the best wireless routers you can buy right now.

These are already pretty powerful, not to mention pretty fast, but as we said, they do pale in comparison when compared to Xiaomi’s 100W Super Charge Turbo technology.","Unfortunately, Xiaomi does not mention when we might be able to see this tech find its way into its smartphones, but we wouldn’t be surprised if it were to be included in future handsets such as the Xiaomi Mi Mix 4 that was recently teased.","Source: Xiaomi (via XDA Developers)","stars Further Reading","Xiaomi’s double-folding smartphone shown of","Xiaomi Mi 9X specs leaked, might be launched","Huawei P30 Pro trolled by Xiaomi after it pok","Xiaomi teaser hints that the Mi Mix 4 is in d","Pocophone F1 wants to be a gaming smartphone","android Best of Phandroid","stars Popular this Weeklaunch","more_vertVerizon’s free robocall blocker is now roll","At the start of the year, Verizon announced that they would be bringing a free robocall blocker tool to its customers, and it looks like the tool is now being rolled out to customers as we speak.","more_vertHow to turn the Samsung Galaxy S10’s hole-p","The debate of whether or not the hole-punch cutout on the display of the Samsung Galaxy S10 is better than the notch is still very much up for debate, but since there’s little anyone can do at this point, why not just embrace it?","more_vertSamsung Galaxy S10+ versus OnePlus 6T: camera","The OnePlus 6T is still one of the best Android smartphones on the market, but how do its cameras compare to those of the new Samsung Galaxy S10+?","more_vertSomeone got their hands on the Samsung Galaxy","Samsung has been a bit secretive when it comes to the Samsung Galaxy Fold, but it appears that someone managed to get their hands on the phone a bit earlier than expected, and here is what we can expect.","more_vertHuawei confirms that the Mate 30 is already i","Huawei only just launched the P30 and P30 Pro smartphones, but it seems that the company is already hard at work developing its next flagship smartphone for the later part of the year.","Terms of Service  |  Privacy Policy  |  Android is a trademark of Google Inc.  |  © Phandroid.com, 2007-2019"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The former Texas Tech coach said on Tuesday that he will draw on his experience at the collegiate level by building “cellphone breaks” into his team meetings.","Kingsbury said that he saw how short the attention spans of young players are during his time in Lubbock and that he began breaking up the meetings into 20 or 30 minute chunks in order to be sure that coaches are “maximizing their time” with the players.","“You start to see kind of hands twitching and legs shaking, and you know they need to get that social media fix, so we’ll let them hop over there and then get back in the meeting and refocus,” Kingsbury said, via ESPN.com.","Like everything else about Kingsbury’s way of coaching a team, the results on the field will determine the ultimate reaction to an unusual way of doing things. If the Cardinals win, he’ll likely be praised for finding a way to engage his players effectively. If they lose, he’ll be criticized for failing to have the team properly focused on the job at hand.","Share this:","48 responses to “Kliff Kingsbury will give players “cellphone breaks” during meetings”","Invitation for disaster.","He had a losing record at Texas Tech, right?  Got it.","Cellphone breaks???…these ain’t college kids Kliff.","is this where we are in the world.

Good name for him because he’s about to fall off it.","Should give them safe spaces.","Treating the entitled generation as though they’re entitled. What possibly go wrong?","This guy is going to be a total failure! Big mistake to hire him in the first place! Wants to be the players friends, instead of a coach! This is the NFL! NOT Pop Warner! The NFL is Grown men getting PAID!\nThis guy is a JOKE!","Huge mistake. I see Chip Kelly 2.0 in the making. I actually feel bad for Larry Fitz and David Johnson. Great Players on a team with a rookie coach who has no clue how to coach men.","What about safe spaces, coloring books and emotional support animals?","These aren’t just meetings, this is really classroom studying and requires more attention.\nIf he gives them 5 minutes every 30 minutes, so what?  Whats the harm?\nHe is focusing on them staying sharp during the entire meeting time.","This is a non-issue","Might as well slip nap time and pajama days in the sched as well Kliffy!!","Amateur hour!","This guy is going to get fired mid-season.","What a joke, God forbid if someone doesn’t look at their damn phone every 5 minutes, they probably feel like the world is coming to an end.","Smart.","These are players getting paid millions not college kids. They can’t stay off their phones during work hours for more than 30 minutes? Who does this in the real world?","Is it possible for another 1 and done in Arizona?","Are they going to have snack time to when their playing with their toys?","He also gonna implement nap time and recess?","How bout after-practice detention?","Ridiculous, these are supposed to be grown men(professionals) not HS boys checking on prom dates. If this is the new wave of coaching, you won’t be King for long. Handling players with kids gloves will result in a BuriedKing !  You can’t be a “buddy” to your players, you must be a Leader! Management 101.","This is a non issue. They aren’t even really meetings. It’s a regurgitation of things already known. Doesn’t hurt to let people attend to other business while basically going to study hall.","I am lost for words…  seriously!","I work on a college campus and I am surrounded by PhDs, deans, chairpersons, etc etc. It is amazing how many of them cannot get through a 2-hour meeting without fidgeting with their phones, reading email, checking twitter, or reading profootball talk.","Has very little to do with “but they are making millions…”","Kliff and several of his staff are in a Clash Royale Clan called Kliff’s Kardinals….it’ll enable the boys some extra bonding time in-between meetings.","You can’t be a buddy to your players is probably the most illogical thing ever. First of all, he’s not much older than the guys on his team. He’s not considered an authoritarian figure, moreso a colleague. Secondly, these are professionals as you all say. Being on their phones won’t stop them from winning or losing. It’s not that simplistic.","Make sure the have their RED BULL and 5 hour energy drinks too!","Can’t imagine Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown , Tom Landry, or Chuck Noll doing this","youngnoize says:\nMarch 27, 2019 at 8:20 am\nThis is a non issue.

Doesn’t hurt to let people attend to other business while basically going to study hall.\n*****************************","They aren’t really meetings? Seriously? If you’re BB and say you’re doing this, ok I get it, you have some cache to get away with it. Kilff had a losing record in college – perhaps they should have done a little more in their prep and meetings?","Player responsibility will increase as the season wears on. They will have to bring milk money and their nap time blankets.","When I was in college my classes were either 50 minutes or 75 minutes, depending on the day of the week; some classes – those once a week – were 3 hours long. No breaks every 20 minutes (although the 3-hour class had a 15 minute break half-way through).","Now I work 9 hours a day – no stopping every 20 minutes to check my phone for messages or look at social media.","Psychologists would tell you people don’t refocus immediately after engaging on their phones.  Their brains get triggered, dopamine is released and it takes 15-20 minutes for their brains to settle down and focus again.","It sounds cutting edge and new age….but it is ultimately a flawed strategy.","“Can’t imagine Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown , Tom Landry, or Chuck Noll doing this.”\n——————————————————————-\nBut what do they know??  They just won Super Bowls and stuff…..","These “young” men are being paid to listen to you and your coaches during meetings. Kliff is enabling behavior that is already destroying our youth. Put the phone down!","It’s the millennial generation, everyone put your head down.","How many times have we heard coaches say they are simplifying things?  The majority of this new generation of players are more athletic but they lack focus and intelligence.  There’s a reason Belichick likes smart, disciplined players.","Their uniforms will need a phone pouch added.","How did that work out for your teams? So t you have a losing record as a college head coach?","I didn’t understand this hiring. There have been really good and great college coaches that utterly failed in the NFL. What makes a GM think that a mediocre one is going to succeed?","Great way to trim your 90 man roster. I say the first player to take his “break” should get a call from Kliff……”Your cut, can you hear me now?”","This guy is gonna bomb.","Hope he brings the orange slices too!","Well it was our generation that was too lazy and self absorbent to raise that generation so what did you think would happen when you let the TV babysit the kids you were responsible for having?","Who would have ever thought that raising baby TV addicts would grow them up to be addicted to electronic devices?","Clever move because by midseason Kliff himself will need to be calling around looking for jobs with colleges because the writing will be on the wall.","Short breaks every 20-30 minutes is good educational pedagogy, whether it’s for cellphone, bathroom, or just mentally processing what you just learned. Even when studying alone, short bursts of study, punctuated by even shorter breaks a couple times per hour, results in better recall later on. It sounds like catering to spoiled millennials but it’s really just a better way of teaching/coaching.","Seems like something Belichick would do, right?","Kliff is smart for doing this. He is going to revolutionize the NFL by thinking outside the box. Write it down boys.","Has to be kidding !!","Milk and cookies? None of those punks would have survived the Sixties.","What he did at Texas Tech worked out so well for him.","Leave a Reply Cancel reply","You must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member?

Not that I don’t like white dudes—but I've seen that movie.\"","\"It really is one of the best, greatest pieces of this story, is feeling like we are in this time,\" Peele went on, as the audience reportedly cheered. \"A renaissance has happened and proved the myths about representation in the industry are false.\"","During the conversation, Peele also spoke about his long path to success, starting with a stint at MadTV and a missed opportunity to join the SNL cast, which apparently led to a stretch of time he spent getting blazed in his room and scheming \"like a comic book supervillain.\" Eventually, those schemes turned into a shit-ton of screenplays—one of which wound up becoming Get Out.","\"Every two weeks I'd go, 'What the fuck am I doing? I'm writing a movie where a black man is victimized and all the white people are evil and I'm trying to get the audience to have fun,'\" Peele said of Get Out. \"But if you could make that fun… that's what brought me back.\"","Peele didn't tease any new projects during the chat, but whatever else he's got cooking, it's safe to say it won't put another Extremely Successful White Male in the spotlight. Apologies to everyone dreaming of an Us spinoff starring Tim Heidecker or whatever. In any case, let's hope Peele pens Lupita Nyong'o another star vehicle sometime soon—her turn as Adelaide and Red in Us better earn her both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars, for the freaky dancing alone.","Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.","Newsletters are the new newsletters.","Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Peppers is not a suspect in the homicide, police say.","5 On Your Side Investigators learned Tuesday that CPD turned over two different reports to the NFL last week.","The first report is from Jan. 29 and is regarding an incident involving a stolen gun belonging to Peppers.","The report states that someone went into a parking garage on East 12th Street, broke into Peppers’ 2014 Range Rover and took a bag with his jersey number on it, sunglasses and an iPad. The report also states that a Glock semi-automatic handgun was taken from the center console.","According to the report, a 57-year-old woman named Marsha Carroll was listed as a possible suspect. Court records show Carroll had a long history of arrests, but the report doesn’t indicate she was ever arrested in connection with the stolen property.","The second report the NFL requested was regarding Carroll’s homicide.","On Feb. 6, Carroll was found beaten, taken to a nearby hospital and later died. A 26-year-old man named Deointa Campbell was arrested and charged with murder and felonious assault for Carroll’s death.","Police say they found Campbell near the crime scene with blood on his hands and pants. When authorities found him, Campbell had a “strong odor of alcohol and appeared to be on some type of substance.”","Campbell told police the blood on his hands was from him biting himself, the report states.","According to the NFL’s request to Cleveland police, a league security representative asked for “any and all documentation regarding the reported theft of items belonging to Jabrill Peppers…” as well as “any documentation indicating Jabrill Peppers is not a suspect in (Carroll’s) homicide.”","A Cleveland police spokesperson told 5 On Your Side investigators Tuesday that Peppers is not a suspect in any investigation, only a victim of theft. However, authorities did confirm an internal investigation is taking place regarding police handling of the theft incident.","It’s not known what the NFL is specifically looking for in the documents it requested from Cleveland police. It’s also unclear why the league wants that information nearly two months after the crimes occurred. A league representative did not reply to News 5, and neither did the security representative who requested the police reports. A Browns spokesperson said he was not aware of the league's inquiry.","Peppers was traded to the New York Giants earlier this month.","Pat Hanlon, senior vice president of communications for the Giants, sent News 5 this statement late Tuesday evening: “We are aware of the situation in Cleveland. The NFL has been aware of this situation for some time. Jabrill is not the subject of an investigation by the Cleveland Police Department.

Snyder's Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice was a commercial success but not exactly a hit with critics, while Justice League failed on almost every level. Snyder left Justice League during post-production and the DC universe bounced back with the hugely successful Aquaman. But although Snyder is no longer involved with DC, he still has some opinions about the films he made.","At a recent Q&A session with the director after a screening of his 2009 film Watchmen, Snyder was asked about the dark tone that his DC movies had, and how fans had an issue with that fact both Batman and Superman kill people in them. As the footage posted to reddit revealed, the director didn't have much sympathy for their point of view.","\"Someone says to me: Batman killed a guy. I'm like, 'F***, really? Wake the f*ck up',\" he said. \"Once you've lost your virginity to this f***ing movie and then you come and say to me something about like 'my superhero wouldn't do that.' I'm like 'Are you serious?' I'm like down the fucking road on that.\"","\"It's a cool point of view to be like 'my heroes are still innocent. My heroes didn't f***ing lie to America. My heroes didn't embezzle money from their corporations. My heroes didn't commit any atrocities.' That's cool. But you're living in a f***ing dream world.\"","Of course, there's still plenty to come from the DC movie universe. Next month sees the release of the more comedic Shazam. In his review, GameSpot's Michael Rougeau said that the film \"is the first DC movie that seems genuinely confident in its world and tone, with no major missteps of which to speak. It's fun, heartfelt, funny, genuine, and surprising, while staying true to its origins and embracing what makes it great.\"","Beyond that, the much anticipated Joker origin movie arrives in October, with Joaquin Phoenix starring as the Clown Prince of Crime. The female superhero team-up Birds of Prey is released in February 2020, and Wonder Woman 1984 follows in July next year. Beyond that there are also 2021 release dates for the standalone Batman movie and James Gunn's Suicide Squad reboot.","Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Miller along with comic book writer Grant Morrison were said to have started writing a new screenplay for The Flash which was said to be grittier than the studio originally intended.","Word had gotten out that Ezra Miller and the studio began bumping heads over the delayed Flash project. Warner Bros. apparently wanted the film to follow a more light-hearted tone whereas Ezra Miller thought it would serve Barry Allen’s story better if it were to go darker.","With potentially two scripts, Warner Bros. has a decision to make. On one hand, they could roll the dice on Ezra Miller and Morrison’s darker take on The Flash or they could choose to go with what they already have planned and recast Ezra Miller once his contract ends in May.","Ezra Miller could very well be knocking on a very particular door with his grittier script for the Flash. We’re talking about potentially seeing Flashpoint on the big screen where Barry Allen awakens in an alternate timeline that has Thomas Wayne as Batman, Wonder Woman at war with Aquaman and the man of steel has gone missing.","What do you think the studio should do regarding Ezra Miller’s script for the Flash? Let us know in the comment section below!","Directed by Zack Snyder, Justice League stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J. K. Simmons, and Ciarán Hinds.","Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.","Justice League is now available on Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital HD.","Source: Full Circle","Top Actors To Replace Ben Affleck In Matt Reeves’ ‘The Batman’","Ben Affleck is officially out as Batman and it's a pretty sad day.","Words cannot describe how sad I am to see Ben Affleck announce that he's no longer Batman. His Batman is why I do what I do. In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I fell in love with his comic book-accurate interpretation of the Caped Crusader. It was a breath of fresh air and it felt like we finally had the one true Batman.","Three years have quickly sped by and we're officially going to receive a new Batman for his next movie. Last night, Ben Affleck announced that he will not return as the Dark Knight in Matt Reeves' The Batman and now everyone's attention has moved towards wanting to know who the next Bruce Wayne will be. Matt Reeves is said to want an actor that's around 20 years younger than Affleck while Warner Bros. wants someone older. My guess is that Reeves wants a fresh start while the studio wants an older actor for crossover potential.","In this list, I will discuss the actors I think can replace Ben Affleck as Batman using the parameters that Matt Reeves and Warner Bros. want. Hit Next to see our picks to play the Batman.","Michael Fassbender","Michael Fassbender is an X-Men alum and no stranger to comic book franchises. The actor has shown multiple levels of range and could definitely handle the Batman/Bruce Wayne personality. If they go with the older range for the next Dark Knight, then Fassbender is probably one of the best choices to take over the role.","Ben Barnes","Ben Barnes is out of a job after The Punisher season 2 and he's one of the best actors in that series. The second season tied up Barnes' arc on The Punisher and the actor has already told us that that he'd love to play the Caped Crusader. Barnes definitely has the pretty boy look going on for him and I wonder what his take on Bruce Wayne could be.","Ryan Gosling","I've said this before and I'll say it again: Ryan Gosling needs to star in a superhero movie. I've always thought Gosling would make a great Batman. Every role that he's done has shown us his capability and he could crush it as Bruce Wayne.","Jon Hamm","Jon Hamm is my top choice for an older Batman. If Warner Bros. wants to cast an older actor for crossover potential, Jon Hamm is the studio's best bet. He has a similar look to Ben Affleck, and c'mon, the guy's look just screams Bruce Wayne.","Armie Hammer","Armie Hammer is 32 years old and was cast as the Caped Crusader in George Miller's Justice League: Mortal. That film will never see the light of day, but that doesn’t mean that Hammer doesn't deserve a second shot at being the Batman. He's charming, broody and will probably give his all for this role. Armie Hammer is a great option because he's young enough for Matt Reeves and Warner Bros. could work in a way for him to crossover with the rest of the DC Extended Universe.","Richard Madden","Game of Thrones alum Richard Madden is my top choice to replace Ben Affleck as Batman. The actor is young, has the look and definitely has the acting chops to play the duality of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Madden just won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television series for the BBC drama Bodyguard, so Warner Bros. may want to quickly snatch him up.","Cesar Galvan","These Producers don’t get it.   The first movie…was a disaster.  Nothing to the G.I. Joe i grew up watching.  The second one was more closer to the original source but they had killed most of the known characters.   They need to reboot and start all over and keep close to the source.  Yes, times have changed but the main core that will go to see this movie will be the adults that were fans of the cartoon when children.   They change the characters or the conflict between Cobra and its not G.I. Joe anymore.   Why is it so difficult to keep it close to the source?  G.I. Joe was alike a Seal Team 6.  The best of the best.  Why can’t they go along with a semi-serious story and keeping the unique characters (one of the reasons i liked G.i. Joe).  It does not have to be corny.","Agreed….and especially hate Snake Eyes’ origin in those films.  And them saying “Millennial Approach” has me worried.","I don’t care what they do…as long as they don’t share a universe with the Transformers…..","Follow Us","Newsletter","Popular Stories","Recent Stories","Banner Illustration by Tom Barton\n\nPrivacy Terms | Copyright Inquiries\n\nHeroic Hollywood © 2018"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Metro going Epic-exclusive after already having been listed on Steam was enough to prompt a rare response from Valve.","Epic also announced that Subnautica and Slime Rancher both exceeded 4.5 million downloads during their respective two-week periods in the free games program.","Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Find out what he said.","targetKeywords":null,"targetParagraphs":["He spoke candidly during the royal tour","During his royal visit to Ghana in November last year, Prince Charles admitted that he has some worries about what lies ahead for the future royal baby, and all babies, due to environmental issues such as plastic pollution. The Prince, who had learned he would be a grandfather again the month before, warned that future generations will face a \"completely polluted, damaged and destroyed world\" unless action is taken – as well as speaking openly about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's upcoming arrival. According to the Daily Telegraph, Charles said: \"I am about to have another grandchild actually. I suspect quite a few of you may too have grandchildren or will do soon.\"","Meghan and Harry will become parents in the next month","He added: \"It does seem to me insanity if we are going to bequeath this completely polluted, damaged and destroyed world to them. All grandchildren deserve a better future.\" During the meeting, where he discussed tackling plastic pollution with government officials and business leaders, he also made a speech on the issue.","MORE: How Meghan Markle will make sure Prince Charles is doting grandad to royal baby","Calling for a fundamental change in how products are recycled, he said: \"It is becoming evident that not following such an approach has disastrous consequences, as is witnessed by the fact that 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean every year, that soon there will be one tonne of plastic for every three tonnes of fish in the sea, and that the dead zones in the ocean, now numbering over 400, are continuing to grow.\"","Charles has a close bond with new daughter-in-law Meghan","His comments came after Princes William and Harry opened up about their childhood with their environmentalist father, telling documentary Prince, Son And Heir: Charles At 70 that he would often take them litter-picking as teenagers.","MORE: Prince Charles' grandchildren have the most touching nickname for him","\"We were in Norfolk on school holidays, and we went out litter-picking with him,\" said William. \"And again, both of us thought, 'Well this is perfectly normal, everyone must do it'. We were there with our spikes, stabbing the rubbish into black plastic bags.\" They were also shown archive footage of Charles making a speech on plastic pollution as early as 1970 – showing it's an issue that the Prince has long been passionate about.","Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story!
