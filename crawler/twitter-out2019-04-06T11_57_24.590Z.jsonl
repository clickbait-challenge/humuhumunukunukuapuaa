Independent brokers fear the move could spur a wider industry trend, as carriers look to cut distribution costs. The move will not affect the firms 1.2 million current policyholders.","Genworths decision is the latest blow to the deeply-troubled industry. Sales of traditional policies have declined by more than 90 percent over the past decade and fewer than a dozen carriers still are selling the product. Most are organized as mutual, policyholder-owned companies. While Genworth still is publicly-held, it agreed in 2016 to be acquired by China Oceanwide Holdings Group. However, the deal has yet to be completed.","Combo products","These days, consumers mostly are buying so-called combo or hybrid policies that link long-term care coverage with annuities or life insurance. According to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, about 350,000 policies were purchased last year, but fewer than 60,000 were traditional, stand-alone policies. Another analyst, LIMRA, estimated that consumers purchased about 260,000 combo policies and about 60,000 stand-alone products in 2017.","Combo products come in many varieties, usually as riders to annuities or to whole or universal life insurance. With life policies, for instance, you may use a portion of your death benefit to pay for long-term care needs. Anything left over would go to your beneficiary.","While these products may be attractive to wealthier consumers, they are complicated and may come with added fees. Middle-income households with limited assets may be able to afford only partial coverage for their long-term care needs. But consumers often are attracted to a feature not available with traditional long-term care insurance: You receive benefits even if you have no long-term care needs.","At least in theory, stand-alone policies still make sense for many middle-market buyers. But high premiums have driven most consumers out of that market, even as uncertain risk has chased away nearly all carriers.","Reserves and rate hikes","In February, Genworth took an additional $327 million fourth-quarter pre-tax charge to boost the reserves it will need to pay future LTC insurance claims. It was just the latest in billions of dollars in reserves it has added in recent years. At the same time, the carrier is continuing its efforts to convince state insurance regulators to allow it to impose annual, small premium increases on policyholders, much like health insurance, rather than less frequent but much bigger premium hikes that are the standard for long-term care policies.","Last month, GE, which still has about 274,000 legacy long-term care policies it sold before spinning off the Genworth unit in 2003, announced it would request $1.7 billion in premium increases through 2029.","Hallway chatter","Last week, I attended the industrys annual conference in Chicago. Many programs focused on finding better ways to measure risk and others were about dementiathe single biggest uncertainty for both carriers and consumers. Roughly half of all long-term care insurance claims come from policyholders with Alzheimers and other dementias.","Other sessions discussed public options for long-term care coverage, such as pending legislation in Washington State to create a social insurance benefit of $36,500. Many insurance executives who had long criticized public programs such as Washingtons, now see it as an opportunity to rethink private insurance.","Company execs also were interested in the new Medicare Advantage benefits for supports and services. Last year, for the first time, Congress and the Trump Administration allowed plans to offer non-medical supplemental benefits such as personal care aides or home modifications.","While these benefits are modest and plan participation is low, this initiative could break down the long-standing barriers between medical care and social supports. And it has some long-term care insurance executives wondering: Could they create a policy that supplements limited long-term care-like benefits for the one-third of Medicare enrollees in managed care?","But much of the hallway chatter was about Genworth, and what seems to be an increasingly challenging future for traditional long-term care insurance.","I am a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center as well as an analyst on aging and retirement policy.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) making an embarrassing, though relatively minor, historical gaffe.","The moment came at some point during her MSNBC townhallwith Chris Hayes on her proposed Green New Deal. While this portion didnt air on Friday night, the network posted an overtime segment online, which is where I spotted AOCsgoof.","Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, in describing the broad Democratic support President Franklin Delano Roosevelt enjoyed during the New Deal era, bizarrely claimedCongress ended up amending the Constitution to remove him from office.","\"They had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt did not get reelected,\" AOC said, a claim that didnt appear toraise any eyebrows from those in attendance. Of course, FDR died in office during his fourth presidential term, and the 22ndAmendment was only passed out of Congress in 1947, not being ratified until 1951.","I posted the clip to Twitter, thinking it wasnt important enough to merit writing up as an actual article:","After the tweet went viral, I half-expected AOC to issue some sort of clarification, jokingly acknowledging the slipup. However, none came.","Then, on Monday, Newsweek made the strange decision to argue she actually got her history right:","The article pointed to an obscure Twitter user who responded to my tweet, saying that because Congress had been talking about the 22ndAmendment while FDR was still alive, AOC got it right. Newsweek then referenced an article from the National Constitution Center about the 22ndAmendment, which the news magazine said backed up AOCs claim.","In reality, the referenced National Constitution Center article never made any mention of FDR being removed from office via the 22ndAmendment, nor did it mention Rep. Ocasio-Cortez  likely because the article was published last year. At some point after I pointed out these mistakes, Newsweek updated its headline to reflect the fact that AOC did indeed get her history wrong. The headline now reads: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Attacked on Twitter for Constitutional Mistake  But Heres the Full Story.","On Monday evening, AOC used this Newsweek post  evidently having read it before it was updated  to mock Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who had cited my tweet and added, We knew the Democrats let dead people vote. According to @AOC, they can run for President, too.","AOC responded: I see from your dead people comment that you get your news from Facebook memes, but the National Constitution Center + Newsweek are just two of many places where you can clarify your misunderstanding of the history of the 22nd Amendment.","So rather than simply admitting goofing and quickly snuffing outthis story, AOC is now lying in an attempt at saving face. Its a bad look coming from a congresswoman who claims she entered politics to clean upWashington. And its an especially bad look for a politician who needs every ounce of credibility she can muster ifshe wants to get her Green New Deal off the ground."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Much, much more is needed.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["5 Ways Federal Agencies Could Botch Trumps Executive Order On Campus Speech","The president recently issued anexecutive orderon campus free speech, surrounded by a dozen students who have challenged violations of their First Amendment rights. While the mostly conservative East Room crowd was pleased to see the administrations engagement on campus speech, the EO itself was short on substance.","This is a good thing; EOs are not the ideal way to make free speech policy. But as a dozen federal agencies now begin to give substance to the order, there are plenty of reasons free speech advocates should be wary.","For all that has been written about it, the actual EO is quite limited. It states simply: It is the policy of the Federal Government to: (a)encourage institutions to foster environments that promote open, intellectually engaging, and diverse debate, including through compliance with the First Amendment for public institutions and compliance with stated institutional policies regarding freedom of speech for private institutions.","It then states that to advance this policy: the heads of [12 different federal agencies with covered grants to universities] shall, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, take appropriate steps, in a manner consistent with applicable law, including the First Amendment, to ensure institutions that receive Federal research or education grants promote free inquiry, including through compliance with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, and policies.","Thats it. The EO merely requires agencies to take appropriate steps to encourage institutions to promote free speech and debate. The challenge will come as the agencies seek to put flesh on these bones.","Many campus free speech advocates appreciate the presidents engagement on this issue but express concern about how the EOs implementation could lead to unintended negative consequences. Thats for good reason. While there are certainly other ways agencies could seek to implement the EO, here are just a few possible ways that, if agencies arent careful. an EO intended to protect free speech on campus could unintentionally diminish it.","1. Pens and Phones","Agency action defining acceptable and unacceptable speech policies may be fleeting. Consistent with the EO, an agency might issue guidance on certain campus speech policies, such as outlawing speech zones, defining speech codes, etc.","But those rules would almost certainly change with the next administration, even in ways that add restrictions to student speech. Pens and phones, as the last two years have demonstrated, are not the best tools for making lasting policy.","2. Creating a New Bureaucracy","The larger concern may not bewhatfederal agencies say about free speech but how they propose to enforce it. Agencies could allow complaints about university policies or actions, investigate allegations, render a decision, and revoke federal funding.","Now think about how many stories about campus free speech issues youve seen in the last year, just on Hannity. Now think about how many attorneys the federal government would have to hire to staff an office to investigate and decide all of those cases.","And if the government hiring spree doesnt concern you enough, a federal office for resolving these cases would also prevent the courts from clarifying and expanding on the scope of First Amendment protections. A potentially massive bureaucracy that also hinders the advancement of the lawyay.","3. Disincentivizing Courts from Doing Their Jobs","Imagine youre a federal judge. State U has prohibited student speech outside certain speech zones. You are prepared to decide the speech zone violates the First Amendment. Then you learn that as a consequence of your decision State U will no longer be eligible for federal research grants on Alzheimers and will be required to refund millions in past grants.","Does this change your analysis of the law? Does it cause you to delay rendering a decision and push the parties to settle the case? Agencies might avoid creating a new bureaucracy by making the court decision the trigger for termination of federal grants. But even this less bureaucratic approach might actually harm efforts to protect free speech on campus.","4. Inviting Attacks on Private Colleges","The president avoided the mistake of applying the same rules to public and private colleges. The First Amendment applies to public universities. It does not apply to private universities. Some private colleges may choose to extend full free speech protections to their students (and faculty). But they are not obligated to do so. The EO tells agencies only to hold private colleges to their own free speech policies.","But if the agencies implement the EO by requiring private colleges to certify that they comply with their own free speech policies as a condition of federal grants, private colleges may be at risk. Under the False Claims Act, a private citizen aware that a government contractor is defrauding the government can sue to force the contractor to repay the government.","Just last year Liberty Universityfaced criticismfor censoring articles critical of the president. As a private university, it is free to do so. But if Liberty claimed to protect free speech and certified to federal agencies that it would comply with its own policies, it would not only be subject to criticism for this failure, but to a potential False Claims Act lawsuit demanding that it reimburse any grant funds to the federal government.","Depending on how the agencies draft their rules, a single instance of a private university failing to comply with its own free speech policies could expose it to millions of dollars in liability.","5. Encouraging Private Colleges to Stop Protecting Speech","There is another option for private colleges seeking to avoid opportunistic False Claims Act lawsuitsjust dont make any promises about free speech. If Liberty and other private colleges simply avoid telling students that they will afford them any free speech protections, they will escape liability, but at the cost of no longer promising their students any freedom of speech. This would hardly be an advance for campus free speech.","So, whats the alternative? Think local. Just in the last two monthsfour stateshave adoptedcampusfree speech legislationfor their public universities. These bills have protected a range of First Amendment interests and avoided the problems that have plagued similar efforts in the past.","InArkansas, a bill broadly protecting student First Amendment rights passed almost unanimously with support from universities. More locally still, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the number of universities with problematic free speech policies hasdeclined for ten straight years. Thats good progress made by students, faculty, and free speech advocates working diligently to support universities as they revise their policies without the need to appeal to the federal government.","The presidents interest in the issue is no doubt heartening to many campus free speech advocates. Yet with recent progress on free speech on individual campuses and at the state level, and given the potential pitfalls of addressing this issue through federal agencies, there remain good reason for advocates for open inquiry and free expression to be wary.","Copyright  2019 The Federalist, a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media, All Rights Reserved.","Copyright  2019 The Federalist, a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media, All Rights Reserved."],"targetCaptions":[]}

With those numbers, Powers writes that the Blackhawks are most likely going to get DeBrincat to eventually sign a six-year deal, likely heading into the $8MM AAV-range, pointing out that a seven or eight-year deal is unlikely since a six-year deal will leave him looking for a third contract at age 27, the perfect age for a long-term extension. If he can continue posting 30-to-40 goal seasons, DeBrincat could be in line for double digit cap hits in the future.","As for Strome, the team may be better off waiting for another year to lock up the young forward. Strome has played well in Chicago with 14 goals and 45 points in 53 games, but both sides would be better off to wait another year for more proof that he deserves a big contract extension.

With the star power of Sandra Bullock behind it, it even scored an Academy Award nomination for Best Film. Behind the scenes, however, drama had been brewing all along. For Michael Oher, the true story of his life was much different than what the movie portrayed and he was definitely taken aback by it all. Add in the elevated tensions that come with making a major motion picture, and it was the perfect recipe for drama on the set. Now, its time to find out what really happened.","1. Less Than Pleased","The Blind Side ended up being a huge success. Audiences loved it. Critics were generally pleased. The film even garnered plenty of awards and award nominations. Unfortunately, it did not quite satisfy one important person: the man on whom the film was based.","journalnow.com","Unfortunately, Michael Oher himself couldnt stand the film. Even though actor Quinton Aaron played him well and as great as a guardian as actress Sandra Bullock might have seemed onscreenOher felt it was a poor representation of his life and went as far to say that the film did more damage than anything else.","2. A Different Personality","If you spent time with the real Michael Oher, you might quickly begin to understand why he was less than enthused with how Quinton Aaron portrayed him onthe field. Not that Aarons performance was bad, of course; it just was not the real Big Mike.","Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images","For instance, the film portrays Michael Oher as being much more reserved, bordering on being a loner. He seems aloof, overly serious, even uptight. But Michael Oher is, in fact, quite the opposite. While he does what he needs to do to excel at his sport, he does it with a smile and a roar of a laugh. In other words, he never takes himself too seriously.","3. Ohers Life Before the Tuohy Family","The film does not hide that Michael Oher endured a rocky past. It even states outright that he had been homeless and lacked any real family. This, of course, is just the simplified version cut neatly into digestible chunks for a movie that has a lot to cover in a short amount of time.","PopLyft","Oher indeed did have a tough life. His mother neglected him in favor of alcohol and drugs. Meanwhile, his father sat in prison, where he eventually was murdered. Whats more, Oher comes from a pretty large family. He is just one of 12 children, none of whom received the support they needed growing up.","4. When Michael Oher Met the Tuohy Family","In the film, the Tuohy family first encounters Michael Oher as a storm-battered boy left out in the rain, his clothes drenched and his body cold. The film would have most believe that thats how their relationship began, with Oher moving in with them and then life starting fresh and anew. However, it was not quite like that.","Heavy.com","While the family did spot Michael Oher at the side of the road, they did not instantly pick him up at that moment. Some time passed, and the next day Leigh Anne Tuohy paid Michael a visit at his new school. After that, the two went shopping for new clothes. In short, the transition was a little more gradual and did not quite happen at the Hollywood pace.","5. Leigh Annes Day Job","In real life, Leigh Anne Tuohy worked as an interior designer. If you are particularly observant, you might have noticed that Leigh Anne mentioned Patrick Ramsey in the film. How are these two pieces of information related, you may be wondering?","Ole Hotty Toddy","Interestingly, Leigh Anne Tuohy worked for the Washington Redskins quarterback. Sure, the fact is not mentioned outright in the film, but the reference was not totally pointless. It was just a well-hidden Easter egg intended for only the most devout of football fans to uncoverand by devout, we mean those who are up to date on players home improvement strategies.","6. Racial Tension","In the film, race is mentioned a couple times: once by Sean Tuohy when he admits to his disbelief at having a black son, and again when a fellow player mentions it jeeringly to Oher during a game. Overall, though, the whole matter receives only cursory attention.","Pinterest.es","In real life, there was a lot more at stake for Michael Oher and the Tuohy family. Although the family enjoyed Ohers presence and found it a pleasure to provide him with a home, Leigh Anne knew that her family might not be so pleased, as they tended to be racist at times. Still, Oher managed to fit in with his adoptive family fairly well, despite their difference.","7. Not All Home Sweet Home","Again, Hollywood embellishment rears its glittering head. In the film, Michael Oher appears to take to the Tuohy family immediately. The Tuohys see him as the perfect son and sibling, and Oher accepts them as the nurturing parents he never had. Sadly, things were not as sunny as the film might have you believe.","90skidsonly.com","Both parties had their doubts. Tension existed between them and likely never broke. Even so, things were far from terrible either. Oher still thinks fondly of his adoptive family. He ended up bonding pretty well with both S.J. and Collins Tuohy. However, it all took time and did not quite happen overnight. Again, that Hollywood illusion of instant perfection can be alluring but deceiving.","8. The True Story Behind His Mentor","In the film, Sandra Bullock plays a nurturing Leigh Ann Tuohy who ultimately instills in Michael an instant love for football. While Tuohy did play a major role in shaping the young football star, he did not gain all his training and all he needed to learn about the game from her.","Vulture","Michael Oher felt that in an attempt to milk out a touching mentor-and-mentee story, the director left out a lot of background information that would have shed some light on what it really took Oher to achieve what he did. As far as he is concerned, the film glossed over the hard work he himself put into reaching his goals.","9. Sandra Bullock Almost Was Not Leigh Anne Tuohy","One of the best things aboutThe Blind Sideis Sandra Bullocks performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy. After all, she even won an Oscar and Golden Globe for her performance. But even she had her doubts about the part.","Pinterest","Sandra Bullock was offered the part several times but declined because the thought of portraying a pious Christian made her nervous. Bullock thought her mind was made up until she met the real Leigh Anne Tuohy. After that, she finally took the role. But she wasnt the only choice for the part.","10. Julia Roberts Says No","So, who else exactly was a possible contender for the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy?Julia Robertswas offered the part, which of course would have been a sweet deal, given the films eventual success.","Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images","However, Julia Roberts turned the part down, feeling it was not right for her. Sandra Bullock took her place in the end, giving an exemplary performance that would reshape her career for the betteras will be even more evident further along in this list.","11. Just Years Apart","Most people who fell in love with the film and who were reasonably-devout football fans can see how Quinton Aaron might pass as as the football legend Michael Oher. They have the same build, after all, and stand pretty close in height. However, there is a small thing that separates the two.","Amirite","Quinton Aaron is actually slightly older than Michael Oher. His birth year is 1984, whereas Michael Oher was born in 1986. Still, the ages match up close enough for the difference to matter very little, right? Quinton Aaron still makes one fine Michael Oher!","12.Famous Friends","Although Michael Oher was not a fan of the film overall, he appears to harbor no ill feelings toward the actors and actresses who helped bring his story to life. In fact, one actress still plays quite the role in the football stars life: none other than Sandra Bullock herself.","thecatholiccatalogue.com","She not only checks in on Oher from time to time, but also the entire Tuohy family. She also is incredibly enthusiastic about Michael Ohers progress as an athlete and cheers him on whenever she has the opportunity. In fact, shecan be found at many Super Bowl games sitting in the bleachers alongside his family, hoping to see him triumph.","13.From Security Guard to Hollywood Actor","You would be hard pressed to find a fan of the film who was not moved by Quinton Aarons stunning performance as Michael Oher himself. Believe or not,this was his first lead role and he had only dabbled in acting with small parts beforeThe Blind Side.","ABC News  Go.com","Aaron was actually working as a security guard at the time he was cast, which is not hard to believe given his strength and stature. He did notexpect toland the role when he auditioned and on his way out, gave his business card to director John Lee Hancock, offering to provide security services on the set during filming. Little did he know he would enjoy the spotlight after all.","14. More Concerns from Oher Himself","To this day, Michael Oher is not a huge fan of the film. It is not just because of how the film ended up portraying him as a person and as a football player. It is also because of how people perceive him today.","USA TODAY Sports","Oher laments that few people see himas he wants to be seen: a serious athlete who came a long way to achieve what he once thought was an unreachable dream. To his dismay, he feels that too many view him as that player who had a movie made about him.","15. Michaels Time at Briarcrest Christian School","If you thought Michael Ohers transition to Briarcrest Christian School was a bit too Hollywood-perfect, you were right. Like other parts of the film, actual events were embellished to evoke a greater emotional response from theaudience.","ThingLink","In the film, the reluctant teachers instantly change their mind about allowing Oher in when they witness how he manages to openup to them. Beyond this, Ohers coach manages to give a convincing, poignant speech to sway the authorities in Ohers favor. In real life, though, it was a little more complicated than that. His coach did advocate for him, yes, but he had to complete some rigorous academic assignments before he could be officially admitted. How else did this movie veer from reality?","16.The Truth Comes Out","Michael Oher did everything possible to correct the errors that were made in the film. To do this, in 2011 he penned an autobiographytitledI Beat the Odds: From Homelessness, to The Blind Side, and Beyond.","Harry How/Getty Images","In it, he gives a more thorough look into his childhood and corrected any misconceptions the film made about him. He also expanded upon a number ofstories he felt the film left unresolved and provided much more information than the movie ever could.","17. The Real Collins Tuohy","One character fans of the film loved was Michaels lovely sister Collins Tuohy, portrayed by actress Lily Collins. The film portrays her to be quite the high achiever herself as a cheerleader and a member of the volleyball team.","Leigh Anne Tuohy","As it turns out, Collins Tuohy was, in fact, quite talented in several areas. Not only did she end up becoming a cheerleader at Ole Miss, she also was a state champion in the sport of pole-vaulting while in high school. Like her adoptive brother, she went on to attend Ole Miss.","18. When Michael Met Sean","As is becoming clear, what we see on the screen is not always what really happened. Onesuch scene involvesthe moment Sean Tuohy meets Michael Oher. As moving as this scene might have been, it toounderwentheavy creative tweaking.","Aceshowbiz","In the film, Tuohy first meets Oher unexpectedly at one of Collins volleyball games. At the game, Oher is cleaning up the debris left behind by hungry spectators. In reality, Tuohy first visited Oher at his school. He dropped in to make sure that Ohers lunch money had processed, in order to ensure that Oher would not go hungry at school.","19. Mighty Preparation for a Mighty Role","As tough as Quinton Aaron was at the time, there was still plenty of work to do to get him to the top of his physical game. To do this, he trained with a real, top-notch college football team in order to really get into the role.","Closer Weekly","The football team at Georgia Tech welcomed Quinton Aaron aboard so that he could train for the role. For this incredible role, getting to know the field was as important as knowing the fellow actors and actresses.","20. Doubts from Briarcrest","Authorities at Briarcrest Christian School were less than enthused about the name of the school being used in the film. Even though, the name of the school in the movie was changed Wingate Christian School, they worried that the movie would still sour the schools reputation because the teachers were shown to dismiss Michael Ohers academic abilities in the film.","News  The Commercial Appeal","As fans know, the school was still represented fully in the film. Director John Lee Hancock was even sure to remember one subtle detail: the schools color, green, prominently displayed throughout the film. In the end, the film did not dishonor the school in any way and simply relayed information vital to the plots progression.","21. Firsts for Quinton Aaron","Playing Michael Oher ended up introducing the starry-eyed Quinton Aaron to a life he never knew before. Not only would he play the leading role in an Oscar-nominated film, he would enjoy the glitzy life that came with such an honor.","The Hollywood Reporter","Before he accepted the role, Quinton Aaron had never flown on an airplane in his life. He would get to experience that when he returned for the second audition for the part. At that time, he would get to experience another first: visiting the sparkling city of Los Angeles.","22. Pushed Along","Supportive parents can be a real blessing. Quinton Aaron learned that quickly, as he might not have even gotten the chance to try out for the part as Michael Oher if it had not been for his doting mother.","TheBlaze","Aarons mother saw the call for the role and instantly thought of her very own son. She read the description of what they were looking for, noted the towering size requirement, and knew instantly that the part was made for Aaron. Thus, she submitted his name for him, hoping that good news would come to her and her son.","23. Determined to Make It Work","Intense training, lots of practice, and more. That is what it took Quinton Aaron to ready himself to play a convincing Michael Oher on the big screen. But what exactly did more entail?","coed.com","The young actor soon found himself embarking on a weight loss journey. In total, he lost 100 pounds in order to get in shape for the role. But Aaron considered that a small price to pay for such a great opportunity. In fact, he said he would have done anything to prove he was still fit for the part. Thus, he shed a significant portion of his body weight over the course of just three months.","24. Sean Tuohy","To some, Sean Tuohy in the movie might look pretty familiar  especially if those people are fans of country music. That is because the actor portraying him is none other than the country music sensation Tim McGraw. Who knew that he had a flair for acting as well?","Country 102.5","As it turns out, Tim McGraw is not the only musical soul on set. You probably recognized another famous last name from the music world: Lily Collins. That is because Lily Collins is actually Phil Collinss daughteryes, Genesis Phil Collins, by the way.","25. Sandra Bullocks Biggest Break Yet","Sandra Bullock was no nobody when she appeared in The Blind Side. The actress already had plenty of credits to her name. She had starred inSpeedalongside Keanu Reeves. In fact, she starred in another fairly-commercially-successful film the same yearThe Blind Sidehit theaters: a rom-com entitledThe Proposal.","kinopoisk.ru","But The Blind Side brought Sandra Bullock more than just an overwhelming amount of critical acclaim and some major awards. She also got to see a record be broken. For the first time ever, an actress would have the spotlight to herself.Bullocksname wasthe only womansnamelegible above the films title, and the film grossed over $200 million at the box office.","26. A Legacy for a Champion","Many people enjoyedThe Blind Side, from the casual moviegoing public to even the most serious of critics. The film not only made a name for itself at prestigious award events like the Golden Globes and the Oscars. And not only was the film a major milestone in Sandra Bullocks career. It also broke a significant record at the box office.","Washington Post","The Blind Sidecame into existence on a relatively modest budget of just under $30 million. It ended up bringing in way more than that: a staggering $309.2 million, to be exact. As a result of its enormous profit, the film has gone on to claim the title as the highest grossing sports film of all time.","27. Picture Perfect","One of the most memorable moments of the film is the Thanksgiving scene. The Tuohy family gather at a crowded table in a warm house to share an abundant meal. Everything appears to be ideal, right down to the turkey bronzed in soft glow. If you look closer, you might notice something.","YouTube","Well, at least, the art buffs were quick to notice this subtle detail. When Leigh Anne went to set down the turkey, the scene suddenly transformed into a replica of the famous painting by Norman Rockwell entitled Freedom from Want. This may or may not have been intentional. In any case, the nice moment definitely captured the palpable moment of family togetherness.","28. Devoted to Good Ol Ole Miss","The Ole Miss spirit is alive and well in this film, of course. After all, theUniversity of Mississippi happens to be the alma mater of Collins Tuohy, Michael Oher, and Leigh Anne Tuohy. Any college football family would envy such a proud lineage.","Saturday Down South","As it happens, though, this is not the first time Sandra Bullock portrayed an Ole Miss alumni. In 1996, the illustrious actress starred in the well-received dramaA Time To Kill.Her character, Ellen Roark, a passionate law student, had also attended Ole Miss as an undergraduate student.","29.The Book that Inspired It All","Its pretty safe to say that Quinton Aaron does an excellent job portraying Big Mike, but what was real, and what was fiction?Much of the film was inspired by a book written by Michael Lewis, entitledThe Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.","NYMag","Michael was onlyone part of the books storyline. The written version ofThe Blind Sideactually told the story of the lives and careers of someone other than Michael Oher. It also chronicled the life of Lawrence Taylor, who played for the New York Giants from 1981 to 1993.","30. Close to Reality","Sport fans definitely noticed familiar faces in the movie, especially regardingthe coaches. Thats because many of the coaches portrayed are actual currentor past football coaches. For example, Houston Nutt plays the coach for theUniversity of Mississippi in the movie. Inreality, he used to be the coach for the University of Arkansas.","Pinterest","Other examples include Ed Orgeron, who now coaches the Louisiana State University team after a long stint at Ole Miss. Another coach in the film was Phillip Fulmer, who once served as football coach for the University of Tennessee.","31. Memphis in Georgia?","As fans of the movie know, the film takes place in Memphis, Tenn. It is also where the real life story of Michael Oher took place and in the movie, Leigh Anne says , I have been in Memphis my whole life. But viewers with a careful eye might have noticed something else in the background.","doblu.com","In one of the scenes,Leigh Anne and Michael walk past a sign that says Georgia Lottery PLAY HERE while at the Big and Tall store. StrangeMemphis is definitely not in Georgia! It turns out that the movie was filmed in Atlanta Georgia.","32. Pay Day","Sandra Bullock was at first extremely hesitant to take on the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy, for religious reasons. However, once she met the real-life woman, Bullock wanted the role so bad that she even agreed to a pay cut to play the role.","infilead.com","Apparently, Sandra Bullock (and likely most Hollywood stars) ask for a set fee to star in a film, which this film couldnt offer. The alternative was to offer her a percentage of the profits. She agreed and it turned out to be quite profitable since the film earned$309.2 million in theaters.","33. Football Fandom","The Blind Side is filled with plenty of special cameos and one fascinating person that made an appearance was Michael Ohers real-life high school football coach from Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Hugh Freeze. Where can you spot him in the movie?","Wesley Hitt/Getty Images","His time to shine on the big screen happens when he plays a University of Arkansas assistant, standing behind the real-life Arkansas Razorbacks coach, Houston Nutt. At the time, Freeze was no longer the Briarcrest coach but had moved on to Tennessees Lambuth University, where he served as the head coach of the football team until switching to Arkansas State in 2010.","34. Wonderbar Blind Side","Before a film is released, it is often only known by its working title. Sometimes this working title is also used when copies of the movie are sent to theaters. Apparently, this is done in order to disguise the identities of highly-anticipated movies.","Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images","In the case of The Blind Side, movie theaters didnt know it by its current title. Rather, the 35mm print was given the very vague title of Wonderbar. The word wunderbar in German means wonderful in English. Were they already anticipating the films success?","35. Family Cameo","Actual people involved in the story of Michael Oher made several cameos in The Blind Side and in one case, it was made by one of the real members of the Tuohy family. The cameo wasnt big but it is definitely interesting.","thescore.com","In the movie, during a scene showing the first game, the realS.J. Tuohy is spotted right next to Tim McGraw, who was playing S.J.s father, Sean Tuohy. After high school, the now-24-year-old S.J. went on to study and play football at Loyola University in Baltimore and is currently a football coach atSouthern Methodist University.","36. Waterloo Whoops!","InThe Blind Side, Michael Oher is told he must improve his grades and academic level in order to be accepted to the fictional Wingate Christian School. In one of the scenes, Michael is shown taking a history test, but something is very odd.","IMDb","In this scene, the camera shows a question about the Battle of Waterloo and where it happened. At the top of the page, it is clear to see that Michael answered that it took place in Germany and the teacher marked this answer as the correct one. In reality, it took place in what was then The Netherlands and now Belgium.","37. Timeline Troubles","When a movie is filmed so soon after something takes place, it may seem that everything has stayed the same in the world. For that reason, a few details managed to get overlooked. One example was in the scene at the recruiting office.","alchetron.com","During this scene, Tom Lemming is given a DVD of Michael Oher, which is resting atop a magazine with football player Bryce Brown on the cover, showing him playing in the Army All-American game of 2009. However,The Blind Sidetakes place in 2003 and 2004 and back then, Bryce Brown was only 12 and 13.","38. Date Discrepencies","A few more time discrepancies are in the film, aside from the one involving Bryce Brown. As mentioned, the movie is set in 2003 and 2004 and some things were not available then. For example, in the movie, Sean Tuohy is shown using the Safari browser on a Windows operating system. However, this only became available in 2007.","Pinterest","Another example is with the particular type of car that Leigh Anne Tuohy drives, a BMW 750LI, which only came out in 2006. Making the discrepancy even more apparent is that this car model underwent a facelift in 2006 and looked quite different from the versions available in 2003 and 2004.","39. No Privacy","Viewers with knowledge of privacy laws probably noticed something a bit strange inThe Blind Side. Leigh Anne, who had not legally adopted Michael Oher yet, was given access to his files at his school in order to monitor his progress.","newsok.com","In real life, a students files are considered confidential and only legal guardians or those with power of attorney are provided access to these. Nonetheless, we see the social worker at Wingate Christian School providing Leigh Anne with all this information.","40. Southern Charmers","The Blind Sideis not just a sports film. Its also a very Southern film! It turns out that the films stars actually are southerners themselves. Sandra Bullock, who played Leigh Anne Tuohy, was born in Virginia and went to high school there (her family spent 12 years in Germany in between). She went toEast Carolina University in North Carolina.","listal.com","Meanwhile, playing Sandra Bullocks on-screen husband was Tim McGraw. He was born and raised inLouisiana and is best known for being one of the biggest musicians in Country music.

Known for its snappy hot dogs, silver-dollar-sized potato latkes and house-baked rye, the booths are large and comfy and the vibe is family-friendly. They serve a minimalist matzo ball soup: a single, unadorned ball with only a few noodles to keep it company. Their meats are smoked in house while the lox is imported from the East Coast. 414 N.

An instant success, they branched out to Century City's Westfield mall and to a larger outpost in Santa Monica, the only location where you can get their matzo ball soup and their babka French toast with vanilla bean whip. At all three Wexler's locations, you order at the counter, Katz's style, and wait for your number to be called. The MacArthur Park pays homage to Langer's #19, piled with soft, lightly peppered, thick-cut pastrami that's tinged with clove and never feels soggy.

But King was also a two-term governor of the Bank of England, the person responsible for translating the last Labour government's plan for an independent Bank of England into a fixture of the financial landscape and an economist of the highest order.","His successor Mark Carney, criticised by Brexiteers for being a traitor for his Remain views, has, to his credit, been more prepared for Brexit than anyone in Whitehall.","Protests erupted last night, as Britain should have left the EU. The sticking point has been the deal and no deal Brexit is judged to be off the table but should we be that worried about it?","The Bank prepared a fat dossier on the potential impact of Brexit on the City, Britain's biggest overseas earner, only to see it gather dust in Whitehall.","Once Carney managed to capture the attention of Westminster he was able to resolve one of the biggest threats to the original March 29 deadline  the fate of 41 billion of derivatives contracts.","The current governor also forged a transatlantic derivatives deal and started to make the case for supranational leadership of the global economy.","In his BBC interview, King was critical of the Chancellor for delaying No Deal preparations until it was too late. We know that Britain's best-run companies, some of our European trading partners and the financial community have not been so foolish.","The world's biggest asset manager, Blackrock, had booked plane tickets to New York for a group of senior staff to make sure that investors did not suffer if an exit on March 29 turned out to be hugely disruptive to trading.","RELATED ARTICLES","Share this article","HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP","One of Germany's biggest northern ports, Bremerhaven, has worked overtime to make sure exports of Volkswagen cars and parts can be smoothly shipped to Britain irrespective of customs arrangements. Astrazeneca set up an alternate production line for its prostate cancer medicines in Sweden, just in case of supply problems in the UK.","Toyota, the world's biggest car maker, plans for production in the UK and there is intense speculation that BMW, far from shifting Mini production to Germany, wants to buy some of the Honda facilities in Swindon when it ships back to Japan in 2020.","This is not fantasy economics. Planning is what well-run companies do when faced with known unknowns.","Poll","Would you back No Deal to get Brexit to happen?","Would you back No Deal to get Brexit to happen?","Now share your opinion","It may be harder for small and medium-sized firms to prepare in the same way. But if the representative business groups, such as the British Chambers of Commerce, spent less time publicly groaning about 'corrosive damage' and more time assisting members with preparations then the landing might not be so bumpy.","King also reiterated a basic truth about the EU and the eurozone. It is far from being a perfect market of 500m, as has so often been claimed.","Greece remains an economic basket case where one quarter of output has been wiped out. Italy has seen no increase in its output for 20 years.","The monetary union, in King's view, has been 'disastrous', and he notes that the British economy has done better than Germany's since the referendum and is still doing so. Diplomacy teaches us that unilateral actions rarely work smoothly, so the unloved Theresa May deal (even with a 39 billion bill) remains the sound option in spite of a partial third defeat.","But as King reiterates, there is no reason to fear the kind of well-prepared No Deal that large swathes of corporate Britain and parts of Europe have been planning for.","Even by US hype standards this is a Lyft off","American brokers and investment bankers are masters of hype.","Before the ride-service Lyft offer, the last tech initial public offering to hit Wall Street was social media site Snap.","The stock soared 44 per cent on its first day of trading. Two years later the shares are trading at just above $10 against a float price of $17 per share.","Lyft's early trades were 20 per cent above the IPO price.","With a queue of other tech floats waiting to follow  including Uber  there was reason not to oversell Lyft, which has never made a profit.","Worryingly, Lyft founders Logan Green and John Zimmer learnt nothing about governance from previous tech floats. They will have 20 votes for each share they hold, against just one for everyone else, giving them 49 per cent control.","Silicon Valley finds it hard to ditch a controversial structure.","Sort your pension or Isa before it's too late","Brexit didn't happen on March 29th, as it should have done, but one event set in stone each year is the end of the financial year.","That happens on 5 April, and it means the clock is ticking if you haven't sorted your Isa or pension.","Editor Simon Lambert, assistant editor Lee Boyce and host Georgie Frost have a tax-beating special podcast looking at cash and investing Isas, pensions and more for your ears .","Press play to listen to this week's full episode on the player above, or listen (and please subscribe and review us if you like the podcast) at Apple Podcasts, Acast, Audioboomand Spotify or visit our This is Money Podcast page.","Share or comment on this article:","Comments 511","Share what you think","The comments below have not been moderated.","The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.","Add your comment","By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.","Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?","Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.","Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?","Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual","We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

TheBorderlands 3 trailer gave fans their first look at the games four playable Vault Hunters, but Gearbox itself stopped short of providing specific details for the characters. However, thanks to past leaks that have since been corroborated by theBorderlands 3 PAX East trailer, we know some details anyway, including the name of the new melee-focused Siren.","The name of the melee-focused Siren seen in theBorderlands 3 trailer is Amara. This was originally revealed a couple of months ago through one of the variousBorderlands 3 leaks that hit the internet well before the game was officially announced. Since other details in these leaks were confirmed by theBorderlands 3 reveal, we can safely assume that the Sirens name is Amara. Of course, Gearbox may still end up changing it before officially naming the character and detailing her abilities itself, but that remains to be seen.","The leaks also give us a better idea of what kind of abilities Amara is bringing to the table. Assuming the leaks are correct, Amara will be similar to Brick from the firstBorderlands, and will have a ground-pound attack and the Phaselock ability. Amara will also be able to project holograms that will be capable of attacking enemies, instead of just being used as decoys.","Again, its possible that this portion of theBorderlands 3 leaked information is inaccurate, but since everything else has been confirmed, it seems unlikely. Even so, we must still caution fans to take this news with a grain of salt until Gearbox itself offers specific details on the four playable characters.","Amara isnt the only Siren that will be featured inBorderlands 3. On the contrary, fan favorite Sirens like Lilith and Maya will also be in the upcoming looter-shooter. Not only that, but theBorderlands 3 villains The Calypso Twins are also Sirens. Or at least, one is a Siren and the other is a male with Siren-like powers.","More details on the Sirens, villains, and Amara should come sooner rather than later. More information onBorderlands 3 is expected to come on April 3, so fans shouldnt have to wait much longer.","Borderlands 3is in development for unspecified platforms."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Beyer","A company that was once the largest seller of long-term care insurance policies, Genworth, has announced that it will now only be selling its policies through direct-to-consumer channels or through employers or affinity groups. This market is a small one currently, but brokers fear that move could spur a wider industry trend as it decreases distribution costs.","The long-term care insurance is already swimming in stormy seas, as sales of traditional policies have declined by more than 90% over the past decade. Less than a dozen carriers still sell the policies. Generally, it is more common for consumers to buy combo or hybrid policies that link long-term care coverage with annuities or life insurance. Approximately 350,000 policies were purchased last year according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, but fewer than 60,000 were stand-alone policies. Combo policies can be seen as a more efficient purchase for consumers because they may use a portion of their death benefit of life insurance policies to pay for long-term care needs. Anything left over would go to their beneficiary.","Dementia and other neurological conditions have increased uncertainty risks within the industry. About half of all long-term care insurance claims come from policyholders with Alzheimers and other dementias. Last year, Congress and the Trump Administration allowed plans to offer non-medical supplemental benefits such as personal care aides or home modifications through the new Medicare Advantage benefits and services.","See Howard Gleckman, Another Shock to the Long-Term Care Insurance Industry, Forbes, April 1, 2019.","Special thanks to Joel C.

HOYER, DEMOCRATS TO DISCUSS 'NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES'","We are told to believe that the White House didnt push back against Russia out of fairness to Donald Trump and because it feared that doing so would spark public outrage.","It was a politically perilous issue for the White House,arguedYahoo News Chief Investigative Correspondent Michael Isikoff. President Obama did not want to be perceived as interfering in the election himself on behalf of Hillary Clinton.","Case closed? Not so fast.","Months before the 2016 election, the FBI opened its Crossfire Hurricane investigation seeking evidence of possible collusion between Russia and a low-level staffer for the Trump campaign. Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey has sinceinformed Congressthat the probe initially targeted four Americans, but confirmed that neither Donald Trump nor his campaign organization itself were among the targets.","That investigation eventually led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who finallyconcludedthat no such collusion took place more than two years after President Trump took office. In the meantime, President Trump endured almost daily attacks from left-leaning journalists and Democrat officials based entirely on the now-discredited allegation.","Shockingly, according to otherreports, President Obama was aware in more general terms of Russias planned effort to undermine American democracy for years.","If President Obama really had concerns that Russia might be working with members of the Trump campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, then it is curious that his administration failed to coordinate with candidate Trump to investigate the FBIs suspicions and take any steps that might be necessary to rid his campaign of Russian saboteurs. They certainly had ample opportunity to do so during the regular, high-level intelligence briefings that presidential nominees receive during the campaign as part of the presidential transition process.","Instead, Obama administration officials merely issueda vague warningto both Trump and Clinton to be on the lookout for Russian infiltrators, and Obama himself maintained public silence on the matter. The White House finallycondemnedRussia in October -- just a month before the election -- despite having been aware of Putins operation for months.","Were they trying to sabotage President Trumps election bid?","The American people only learned of this significant delay a year later, when the Washington Postrevealedthat a courier from the CIA had delivered an intelligence bombshell to the White House in August 2016, containing a report drawn from sourcing deep inside the Russian government that detailed Russian President Vladimir Putins direct involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the U.S. presidential race.","Shockingly, according to otherreports, President Obama was aware in more general terms of Russias planned effort to undermine American democracy for years.","The Obama administration received multiple warnings from national security officials between 2014 and 2016 that the Kremlin was ramping up its intelligence operations and building disinformation networks it could use to disrupt the U.S. political system, Politico reported in 2017.","The first realretaliationagainst Moscow, however, did not come until right after Donald Trump won the presidency, at which point the White House announced mild sanctions against several Russians.","When ObamatoldRussian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more flexibility with Moscow after the 2012 election, few expected the U.S. president would be this flexible with one of Americas greatest geopolitical foes.","CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","Why didnt President Obama take a tougher stance on Russia? Why did he wait so long to address Moscows election interference? Did he really mean it when he famouslymockedMitt Romney for viewing Russia as our biggest threat on the world stage?

In this post, Andy Tattersall draws on best practice from the sphere of viral marketing to develop the concept of Scholarly Enticement. He then presents a toolbox of simple techniques that can be applied by anyone across any discipline, to enhance the Scholarly Enticement of research.","Academia has a lot to learn from the outside world, especially the Web. The pressure on researchers to generate impact and attention have meant academics have tried to explore new and inventive ways of communicating their research. Many research papers fail to receive any attention at all and there may be a way to help them reach wider audiences outside of the academic domain. Given the success of email phishing and more recently clickbait websites, there may be some value in employing the former to disseminate outputs. Clickbait is a very negative term and has received a lot of bad publicity in recent years. My proposal is for the term scholarly enticement to be used as a way to lure curious readers to explore your latest research. The principles of clickbait can be applied to ensure research using this method has:","The research itself will remain untouched and not follow the principles of churnalism or yellow journalism. The aim of scholarly enticement is to get the reader to visit your works although there is no evidence they will stay there.","Social analytics company BuzzSumo analysed 100 million headlines to find out what the top headline phrases were. They produced a list of three word phrases or trigrams that gained the most Facebook likes, shares and comments. To help academics align their research with the principles of scholarly enticement, I have created a template of common clickbait trigrams from top headline phrases and applied them to generic research titles. You can mix and match your clickbait phrase with your own research.","The mix and match list approach","In addition to some of the suggestions above, you can employ the list method. This is especially useful for quantitative research and is ideal for creating scholarly enticement across multiple pages. You can use a mixture of trigrams from the list above and create a research paper that has a title like this:","Interdisciplinary case study: 23 reasons why the planet is getting hotter and you wont believe number 15.","If your intelligence and analytical gathering for impact includes metrics such as page hits consider breaking your research up across 20 separate web pages. Each page should have enough scholarly enticement to ensure the reader proceeds on to the next web page in the sequence. It is important that you leave your most important findings till the very last page, that way you maximise the number of clicks on your website. In some cases it is legitimate to leave out your conclusions, results and in extreme cases all text and just use images.","Images are instrumental as part of the scholarly enticement process so it is important you apply the right images to accompany your research. For anyone seeking inspiration for their research I suggest you use these suggestions for images in the corresponding research.","Research and clickbait have surprising similarities (see my list of 25 similarities and you wont believe number 18) which can help improve scholarly enticement. Research comes from curiosity to solve problems, that curiosity can be employed to draw attention from the outside. Research often explores human and emotional issues and clickbait titles are designed to play on our frailties, which in turn could gain you some valuable research impact. The truth is that for many of us we cant resist clicking on the link, knowing full well it is clickbait. If academics can harness the skills of scholarly enticement they will see greater engagement with their research, just make sure you dont link to the paywalled version of your work.","Note: This article is purely satire and clickbait should be treated with caution, furthermore the article gives neither the views of the author, the position of the LSE Impact Blog, nor of the London School of Economics.

You must be logged in to use this feature.","Michele Romanow, who is a Canadian technology entrepreneur, television personality and venture capitalist, poses for a photo at her Toronto home on Sept. 26, 2016.","Michelle Siu/The Globe and Mail","Dragons Den star Michele Romanows online financing company, Clearbanc, was born out of the frustrations she faced when launching her previous company, Buytopia.ca. At the time, she didnt want to get financing from the banks because they all wanted personal guarantees against her assets. Getting venture capital wasnt ideal either, as she didnt want to give up equity in the company. It meant we had to run everything on a shoestring budget instead of getting to grow faster, Ms. Romanow says.","Her experiences fuelled her to launch Clearbanc, which caters to e-commerce companies that want money for marketing. The financing company promises you can apply online in minutes and says money can arrive in entrepreneurs bank accounts in as little as 24 hours.","Theres no set repayment date, so if business is slow, entrepreneurs can take more time to pay. Ms. Romanow says applying has no impact on the owners or the businesss credit scores, and Clearbanc has no claim to the entrepreneurs personal assets. This is the product I wished I had during the early days of my business, she says.","Story continues below advertisement","Another selling point is the simple structure. We make it really clear what your cost of capital is, Ms. Romanow says. We charge 6 per cent for our capital. If we give you $100,000, you owe us $106,000 at the end of that. She says the fee is always 6 per cent and there are no extra fees charged on top.","Theres been a lot of excitement about the four-year-old company, and it raised US$120-million in venture capital to fund its growth last year. It all sounds great, but does Clearbanc live up to its lofty claims? We talked to Clearbanc customers and financing expert Andrew Zakharia to find out.","Getting set up","Applicants give Clearbanc read-only digital access to their business bank account and payment-processing accounts (for example Stripe, Square, Shopify or Paypal). They also need to give access to their online ad spending accounts, typically Google Ads or Facebook.","We are looking for positive unit economics, Ms. Romanow says. If you are making really cool wooden iPhone cases, were just verifying youre making those cases for $10, selling for $50 and its costing $10 in Facebook ads to sell a case.","Ms. Romanow says that while you can get funded in as little as 24 hours, often business owners dont remember the passwords to all their accounts and phone with a few questions, so it typically takes around a week to get set up.","Businesses need to have an average monthly revenue of at least $10,000 for the past six months, and must share their articles of incorporation. Ms. Romanow wont reveal Clearbancs approval rate, but says its pretty high.","Mr. Zakharia, an accountant and founder of AZ Accounting Firm in Toronto, recently got a Clearbanc advance on behalf of one of his e-commerce clients.","Story continues below advertisement","The whole process of connecting was very simple. It took 20 to 30 minutes to apply and I called to ask one question. It took three days to get approved and the money arrived five days after that.","Michael McNaught, founder of RV rental marketplace RVezy, got an advance from Clearbanc last fall. It was a very smooth, transparent and simple process to follow, he says. We got access to the funding within days of the application.","Mr. McNaught says Clearbanc is a welcome alternative to banks, which are reluctant to lend to digital companies without physical assets. We are then able to deploy those funds to directly fuel our growth without giving up any equity in the company.","Clearbanc advances start at $10,000 and the largest one it has done was for $10-million, for a company that used it as an alternative to raising a Series B venture round. The money advanced is supposed to be put toward marketing, which includes buying online ads and hiring a marketing agency. The funds are deposited in the companys bank account or added to a Clearbanc debit card, which can be used anywhere that accepts Visa or Mastercard.","While the product is currently available for e-commerce companies only, Ms. Romanow has plans for expansion. She says in addition to expanding internationally, Clearbanc is testing models to allow software-as-a-service companies to use the platform.","Payback time","The money Clearbanc gives out is considered a cash advance on future sales, not a loan. The funds are repaid by having the businesss payment processor route an agreed upon percentage of future revenues to Clearbanc until the advance and the fee are repaid. The payback rate ranges from 1 per cent to 20 per cent of sales.","Story continues below advertisement","Ms. Romanow told The Globe and Mail and other media outlets that the only cost is a flat fee of 6 per cent on the amount advanced, but it turns out thats not always the case. While the majority of the businesses we spoke with paid a 6 per cent fee, one paid 8 per cent.","When asked for clarification, Ms. Romanow says: Depending on how you use our capital, its 6 per cent to 12 per cent. Its cheaper  6 per cent  if you use our capital on digital ads like Facebook and Google because we have deep data science and understand the paybacks so we can offer lower fees. The vast majority of our fees are at the lower range. The Clearbanc website doesnt list the cost of an advance, but says the fee is determined based on your business data.","Its important to understand that the 6-per-cent to 12-per-cent advance fee isnt the same as the APR, or annual percentage rate youd see on a traditional loan. Thats because the amount of time it takes to repay the Clearbanc advance could vary. Ms. Romanow says the businesses typically repay the advances in six to 12 months.","Things to watch out for","The e-commerce companies we spoke with that used Clearbanc were very enthusiastic about the service. Jesse Burnett, co-founder of Toronto footwear company TKEES, says he wouldnt hesitate to get another advance from the company.","Our ability to grow has been capped by our access to capital. So any time we have access to capital, I can free up capital for other places in the business, he said. \"2018 was a solid growth year for us and were looking to Clearbanc to accelerate that this year.","Mr. Zakharia agrees that Clearbanc is a good option because its quick, theres no personal credit check and the entrepreneur doesnt need to put personal assets on the line. In terms of the cost, he says Clearbanc is reasonable when compared with other online lenders.","Story continues below advertisement","An 8-per-cent advance fee works out to the equivalent of a 27-per-cent APR if its paid back in six months with relatively consistent payments, Mr. Zakharia calculates. If paid back over one year, the APR would be approximately 14.5 per cent. This compares with the 20 per cent to 30 per cent or more that other online lenders typically charge, he says.","However, business owners should be aware there could be lower cost options. Id go first to a traditional bank followed by the BDC [Business Development Bank of Canada] if you want the lowest interest rate, Mr. Zakharia says. But if someone doesnt want to involve their personal credit, then Clearbanc would be the best.","Mr. Zakharia warns that businesses should only use a product like this that cuts into future revenues if the money is going to bring in additional sales. Using funds such as this to cover fixed costs could set a business up for cash-flow problems. If youre relying on this money to fund your operations, this could get you in trouble because you will have less cash available until this loan is paid off.","The Globe and Mail Small Business Summit will give you practical ideas to grow your business.

While Americas attention has been focused primarily","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["You can subscribe to theKrassenCastpodcast oniTunes,Youtube. andGoogle Play.","While Americas attention has been focused primarily on the Mueller report, over the course of the last several weeks, a story that likely isnt clearly captured in the Mueller report has been building steam. For well over a year now, there has been speculation about Jared Kushners security clearance, as well as his meetings and ties with various leaders within the Middle East. Now it appears as if this speculation is becoming a full-blown scandal.","Last week on KrassenCast we spoke to Vicky Ward, an investigative journalist and author of the new book Kushner Inc. Since then, Ward, who has been investigating ties that Kushner has had with the Saudis, Emiratis and Qataris, has come across new information that appears to imply that the presidents son-in-law may be extorting the nation of Qatar. HillReporter has also been in contact with several sources with ties to the Qatari government, which also help confirm some of the information that Ward has provided. Ward made another appearance today on KrassenCast, in Episode 12, that is now available oniTunes,Youtube. andGoogle Play","It all started back in April of 2017, after Jared Kushners father, Charles Kushner, met with the Qatari finance minister at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City.","Charles Kushner asked for $1 billion according to someone in that meeting, to whom I have spoken. The Qataris turned Charles Kushner down because the deal was a bad deal, Ward explained to KrassenCast.","The deal she is talking about was in regards to a building owned by Kushner Properties located at 666 5th Ave. At the time, the company was headed towards a foreclosure of the property as a balloon payment came due in January of 2019. According to some sources, the revenue from the building only covered approximately 50% of the mortgage payment.","Ward then went on to explain the shocking details of what happened next, according to Qatari officials:","What I have learned is that in the ensuing month [May 2017] before the US visit to Riyadh, Jared Kushner got on a plane and flew to Doha, the Qatari capital, and he reamed the Qatari ruling family, the al-Thanis, for not doing the deal with his father They began to feel that he was indirectly threatening their sovereignty. The next thing they know, when they show up to the summit in Riyadh, the Emir, the ruler of Qatar, arrives with an entourage, but his entourage is suddenly cut off from him, and not allowed into the summit at the same time by the Saudis, which he felt was a move to deliberately make him look weak. You have to remember during this summit, Jared and Ivanka go off for a cozy secret unmonitored dinner with [Saudi Crown Prince] MBS. Nobody knows what they talked about, Ward explained to KrassenCast.","Just ten days later, against the advice of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis, the United States supported the Saudi and UAE-led blockade of Qatar. On June 6, 2017 President Trump shockingly supported the blockade of a key US ally in the region, forcing many within his own Administration and the GOP to question the move publicly.","What the Qataris found was not just a blockade. There were Saudi [and] Emerati troops on their border, Ward explained to KrassenCast. What they interpreted this as, was Jared Kushner basically saying, if you dont pay my father and pay off this building, look whats going to happen. Were going to, Im going to, the Americans are going to sanction an invasion of your country. Sources in the State Department say, yes, its true; troops were on the border, Ward continued.","Nine months later, a Canadian company, Brookfield Partners, who the Qatari Investment Authority owns a $1.8 billion or 9% stake in, bailed out Kushner Properties, with a 99-year lease agreement for 666 5th Ave.","They bail it out in a deal that makes absolutely no economic sense. They do a 99-year lease and they pay the entire 99-year lease up front. You dont need to be good at math, you dont need to be in the New York real estate community to understand how crazy that is, Ward told KrassenCast.","Around this same time, President Trump publicly shifts course, no longer supporting the blockade, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Saudi Arabia to stop the embargo.","Last week, after hearing from two sources claiming to be familiar with the deal, HillReporter reached out to Brookfield for comment. Andrew Brent, the head of communications for Brookfield Properties denied that Qatar or QIA had any involvement in 666 5th Ave. deal.","Please use this from me as a spokesperson for Brookfield as our on-the-record response to your inquiry: Neither QIA nor any Qatari officials had any involvement at any point with Brookfields transaction for 666 Fifth Avenue,' Brent told HillReporter","When we specifically asked Brent if the Qatari government knew that the deal would be taking place prior to its announcement, which would have been counter to other public statements made by Brookfield, Brent cut off all communications with us. In fact, we called and emailed him, as well as the companys Senior Managing Partner and the Chairman, Ric Clark, several times, without getting a response.","We asked Ward her opinion on whether Qatar wanted it to be known that Kushner was likely extorting their nation by using the Saudi government as his pawn. Her response was rather frightening.","I think the Qataris probably want it out there, but they dont want their fingerprints on it because that would be dangerous to them. I think theyre genuinely afraid of Jared Kushner, so they dont want to be associated with getting the story out there. They think their sovereignty is under threat and Jared is behind it. So, and they want that to end, Ward explained.","Ward closed out the interview with the shocking revelation that she has heard that there is documentation out there to prove this apparent extortion attempt by Mr. Kushner and the Trump White House. Ward is continuing to investigate the matter. HillReporter has also separately been made aware of possible documentation that exists by additional sources.","The entire, shocking interview with Vicky Ward is now available on iTunes,Youtube. andGoogle Play, as well as in the embedded video below.","Vicky Wards new book is now available on Amazon.","You can subscribe to theKrassenCastpodcast oniTunes,Youtube. andGoogle Play."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Theres been speculation that he and Jimmy Butler are interested in teaming up, that he and LeBron James are interested in rejoining forces and that he and Kevin Durant are planning to spurn their teams to sign with the New York Knicks in the summer.","The latest speculation is that Irving would prefer signing with the Nets over the Knicks in the offseason.","Per Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News, The Brooklyn Nets are also in the running for the enigmatic champion. In fact, some sources around the league believe that Irving prefers the Nets.","New York is expected to make a summer run at point guard Kyrie Irving, but the Brooklyn Nets are also in the running for the enigmatic champion. In fact, some sources around the league believe Irving prefers the Nets. In an interview done recently with NBATV, David Griffin  who was the Cavs GM at the same time Irving played for Cleveland  suggested that was the case. Coincidentally, Irving is scheduled to play in Brooklyn with the Celtics on Saturday.","I think Brooklyn is the fit thats better for him in terms of his mindset, Griffin said. I think he likes what theyve done there, culturally.","The idea that Irving would prefer to sign with the Nets over the Knicks makes sense from a purely basketball standpoint, with Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson earning respect around the league and the Nets themselves having shown steady improvement and looking like a team worthy of playoff-contention  even without players of Irving or Durants caliber.","In fact, Brooklyn is currently ranked seventh in the Eastern Conference standings. At 38-38, theyve already won 10 more games than they won all of last season and 18 more games than they won in 2016-17. They play hard, unselfishly and maximize the talent on their roster.","Ultimately, with the Nets set to have up to $54.6 million in cap space without making any trades (per Spotrac), theyll have enough to sign a max free agent or two players on near-max contracts. Nonetheless, whether Irving wants to play by himself or with a player like Jimmy Butler or Durant, they present themselves as a better option than the Knicks on the court.","Though led by a respected head coach in David Fizdale and in line to draft a top prospect this offseason, New York isnt as far along in their development as the Nets. They have fewer veteran players and established locker room leaders as well.","Players want to be on a team that they believe is headed in the right direction and though the Knicks have the potential to be that type of ball club at some point in the future, the Nets are already there.","Regardless, the Celtics still present a better option for Irving than either the Knicks or the Nets from a basketball standpoint. Theyre led by a renowned head coach in Brad Stevens, have already achieved a fair amount of regular season and postseason success and they have far more talent than either New York or Brooklyn.","The only reason Irving would prefer to sign with the Knicks or Nets is if he was attracted to the New York market and wanted a homecoming of sorts.","2019 nba free agency, boston celtics, kyrie irving, nba free agency, Analysis, News","More Celtics Wire","Latest","Injuries","Brad Stevens on Aron Baynes' health after Friday scare: 'He's Baynes'","News","Gordon Hayward did something no Celtic has since 1986","Injuries","Jaylen Brown out, Marcus Morris upgraded to questionable vs. Pacers","Interviews","Danny Ainge has no regrets about trading Kendrick Perkins in 2011","News","Celtics' Two-Way player P.J.

Who's to say he can't make it happen?","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Tottenham's Harry Kane, the world's best striker, has his sights set on a career in the NFL. Who's to say he can't make it happen?","This is an ESPN FC feature.","They couldn't wait for Mondays at Larkswood Primary, in northeast London near the Essex countryside. Five or six local clubs played in the Premier League every year. After each weekend's games, the boys would come to school ready to argue about which of them was best. \"You're going back and forth with each other whenever you pick up a good result,\" Harry Kane says. \"But obviously at the time, Arsenal and Chelsea were stronger than Tottenham. Finishing higher, winning trophies.\"","In 2003, when Kane was 9, Arsenal placed second in the league and Chelsea fourth. The next season Arsenal won the title, with Chelsea right behind. The year after that, they switched places and Chelsea won.","Tottenham Hotspur? Keep looking down the table. Further down, past Fulham, past Charlton Athletic and if you've never heard of Charlton Athletic, well... that's the point. Both of those London clubs finished ahead of Spurs in 2003, and it was no aberration. The following season, they did it again. Still, Kane stayed steadfast, even when he briefly played in Arsenal's youth program. You pick a team when you're small, he explains, and often for no logical reason. If you're loyal and determined, you stick with it.","It couldn't have been easy. Year after year throughout Kane's childhood, Spurs were an afterthought, seen as another game on the schedule. Some of the better football players around had passed through White Hart Lane --  Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker, Teddy Sheringham and Jurgen Klinsmann -- but none stayed long enough to help win the league, or get close. \"People forget that, not too long ago, we were nowhere near this level,\" Kane said, sitting on a couch at the club's training grounds in Enfield, north of London, one afternoon at the beginning of March.","He's Spurs' leading scorer now and has been for four seasons, which happen to coincide with Tottenham's best run of finishes in more than half a century: third, second and third in the past three campaigns, after failing to place as high as second since 1963. They're now third again this year with eight games left. \"We've got as many points as we've ever had, I think, at this stage of the season,\" Kane added. \"We've done so much in a short space of time.\"","Kane is happy with Spurs' progress under Pochettino. \"Of course we want to go on to the next level and win the Premier League, and win trophies. But to consistently outperform teams that have always been above us shows that we're in a good place.\" Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images","Until a memorable 3-1 victory last season, Spurs hadn't won at Chelsea since the Premier League was still called the First Division, the day Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990. And until the season before that, they hadn't finished ahead of Arsenal since 1995, when Kane was 1. They've also made the Champions League three years in a row, after doing it once ever before that -- and they advanced to the quarterfinals for the third time after disposing of Borussia Dortmund. As March turns to April, they sit third in the Premier League. You can't put all those thirds in a display case, but they'd serve Kane well back at Larkswood. \"Of course we want to go on to the next level and win the Premier League, and win trophies,\" he said. \"But to consistently outperform these teams that have always been above us, it shows that we're in a good place.\"","Kane's rise has been equally dramatic. When Mauricio Pochettino became the manager in 2014, Kane was languishing on the depth chart, a perennial up-and-comer who'd gone out on four loans. Now? He's a two-time Premier League top scorer, England's captain and even a Member of the British Empire, as ordained by the queen. He's rated as a $175 million talent by Transfermarkt, a site that tracks such valuations, and ranked the No. 1 striker in the world by ESPN FC. \"He's topped everyone's expectations,\" says Roy Hodgson, now at Crystal Palace, who gave Kane his international debut in 2015 as England manager.","Incrementally each season, Kane has been pulling his team toward the top with him. As of mid-February, Spurs had even moved within hoping distance of first, five points out. Then they went to Chelsea and the 1990s kicked in. If they'd allowed only the first goal, which squirted between the legs of keeper Hugo Lloris, the loss might have been surmountable. But late in the game, defender Kieran Trippier pushed a back pass beyond the reach of the advancing Lloris and into his own net. \"Tottenham Hotspur,\" the Chelsea fans sang, \"it's happened again.\"","More from ESPN FC","The hater's guide to soccer rivalries","Inside the Ajax dream factory: where selling Frenkie de Jong is no big deal","ESPN FC home","If you've been following the Premier League, you'd know that isn't quite fair. One of the clubs Spurs has been chasing, Manchester City, is the world's richest. The other, Liverpool, bought four players for nearly $200 million during last summer's transfer window. In that same period, Spurs set a Premier League record that won't be broken by spending zero dollars. \"We are third, and we didn't invest in the last two transfer windows,\" says Pochettino.","Much of that is because of the investment in an ambitious new stadium, which Spurs owner Daniel Levy has self-funded in north London, beside where White Hart Lane stood for more than a century. \"I know very well what happened, from the inside,\" Pochettino says. \"I know very well with what we are working. But the people can't understand. They want to judge us like another team, like Arsenal or City or Liverpool or Man United.\" Before he can change what others think of Spurs, Pochettino says, he has to change what they think of themselves. Doing that, he insists, is \"even more important\" than winning a title.","So far, at least, he has Kane convinced. \"I've always said as long as the club is moving in the right direction and showing the right ambition, I want to be part of the journey,\" Kane says. But he turns 26 in July, and the world's best striker also ranks among its most ambitious. He has been patient since primary school, but even he doesn't know how much longer he can wait.","After almost an entire season of delays, Tottenham's new stadium is open for business. The U-18s beat Southampton in the first match there but Harry Kane will soon get his chance to make a mark. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images","There are players who make you gasp when you watch them, the ones who race across the field like wild horses. Then there's Harry Kane. He runs with a slight stumble, like somebody keeps pushing him from behind. Tall and gangly, he shuffles into a scrum of defenders with the ball and it's always a surprise to see him emerge with it on the other side. He isn't having a particularly impressive afternoon, you're thinking, except -- whoa! -- there's a goal with a perfectly placed header off a corner, and -- wait! -- there's another off a rifled shot with time waning. Then the game is over, Spurs have won and Kane has done simply everything.","Until recently, those who mattered didn't know what to make of Kane. He was cut from Arsenal's program as a preteen because he was \"chubby and not very athletic,\" the club's longtime youth director revealed to an Italian newspaper. He shouldn't be embarrassed about it because everyone else got Kane wrong too. After a wasted year in Watford, he ended up with Tottenham's juniors, where he'd wanted to be from the start. There too, nobody seemed to think Kane had a future except Kane himself. \"My aim was always Spurs,\" he says. \"It was playing for Spurs in the Premier League. And from the time that I was 14 or 15 and I started to get better and better, I realized it was a goal that I could actually get to. There were times when it started to look unlikely, but that was always my mindset.\"","\"It would be a wrench for him to leave Tottenham and go somewhere else. If he goes anywhere, it would be Real Madrid. He's a Real Madrid kind of player.\"","A handful of players at every academy are prized commodities, fawned over by coaches and whispered about by devoted fans. The others fill the space around them. At every level, Kane seemed to be just good enough. \"Did he look like he would be an England captain and a top international striker? You would have to say no,\" says Russell Slade, who managed Leyton Orient in 2011 during Kane's five-month stay there, playing in the third tier of English football. \"He was this skinny, gangly, 6-foot-4 17-year-old. Was he terrifically quick? Not really. But he maximized everything he had. And he had this great appetite to make a difference. He believed he could make a difference.\"","By then, Kane had already learned to cultivate his greatest skill, which is finding space to operate. Somehow, amid a crunch of defenders, he'll create enough room to receive a pass. \"He can lose you in a telephone box,\" says Slade. \"He only needs half a yard to get a shot off,\" says Jordan Pickford, the Everton goalkeeper, who plays with Kane for England. \"And when he makes half a turn, he knows where the goal is without even looking. Nine times out of 10, that shot is going to be on target. Ask any defender -- he's very, very difficult to mark.\"","It's not just about Kane as far as Tottenham's impressive form is concerned. Dele Alli, left, and Christian Eriksen, center, have contributed 10 goals and 11 assists in the league this season. Kane has 17 goals and four assists. Nick Potts/PA Images/Getty Images","Kane showed that the next season at Millwall, one level up in the Sky Bet Championship, where he played when he was 18. In 14 games, he scored seven goals and it isn't hyperbolic to say that he saved the club from relegation. Still, that wasn't enough to keep him around White Hart Lane. At the start of the 2012-13 season, he was loaned to Norwich. The following January, he moved to Leicester. Along the way, Harry Redknapp had been replaced as Tottenham's manager by Andre Villas-Boas, but it hardly mattered. Villas-Boas looked at Kane and didn't see a Premier League player either.","Kane was on loan somewhere -- he doesn't even remember where, there were so many -- when he first became aware of Tom Brady.","\"I started watching him on YouTube,\" Kane says. When he came across a documentary about the quarterback, he watched that too. \"We've had a similar path being doubted when we were younger. Maybe not being the best athletes as kids.\" In Brady, who had willed his way to stardom by refusing to accept anyone else's judgment, Kane saw a finished version of himself. \"It was quite a big inspiration,\" he adds. \"Not many people thought he'd become that good, or even play in the NFL, and he went on to become the best ever. At the time, it gave me a real boost to say, look, anything is possible. If you have that self-belief and that drive and that hunger, you can do it.\"","While Brady was winning Super Bowls, Kane played in his first Premier League game for Spurs, against Newcastle in August 2012. He'd done what he'd set out to do; then he set out to do it every week. \"He never felt he had a ceiling,\" says Tim Sherwood, who worked as Tottenham's first-team coach under Redknapp. \"He still doesn't. Like the Lionel Messis and Cristiano Ronaldos of the world. He sees himself in that company.\" Even now, it sounds ridiculously brazen. But when Villas-Boas was fired by Tottenham, Sherwood was made the manager for the rest of the 2013-14 season while Spurs wooed Pochettino. He gave Kane a chance to play. \"How did we know Frank Sinatra was a good singer until he sang onstage?\" Sherwood asks.","That April 7, Sherwood started Kane against Sunderland. Kane scored. Sherwood started him in Tottenham's next game, at West Bromwich Albion. Kane scored. Sherwood started him against Fulham. Kane scored again. Kane started every game for the rest of the season.","Sherwood had found a Sinatra.","Kane isn't content to merely conquer soccer. \"If you play in the Premier League and the World Cup and then in the NFL, would you then be considered one of the greatest sportsmen ever?\" he said. Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images","Out the train window, which is how you get the best view, it looks like a flying saucer. On the street it looms, gloriously but incongruously, over a neighborhood of ramshackle storefronts selling jerk chicken and calling cards to Africa. In early April, Tottenham's new stadium will finally be ready for a football match.","The designs for the new facility, advertised as the best in the world, were made in 2008. Since construction began in 2015, the projected opening date has been pushed back countless times, including almost on a match-by-match basis throughout the 2018-19 season. The delays left Tottenham lingering in their temporary home at Wembley, suitcases packed but nowhere to go. During that time, too, the cost -- bloated by overtime fees, nearly a season's worth of additional Wembley rentals and problems with the safety system -- has more than doubled, from roughly $600 million to more than $1.2 billion.","The idea of building a new stadium, which includes both an artificial surface for NFL games and a grass pitch, is meant to lift Spurs into the revenue-generating class of Arsenal, Chelsea and the Manchester clubs. Eventually a massive naming rights deal will be signed that may even approach the $500 million over 20 years that Levy is said to be seeking. For now, though, the stadium has become a very expensive, glass-and silver paneled millstone around his neck. The annual service on $800 million in loans will make splash spending nearly impossible this year, and perhaps years to come. Skeptics are quick to note that you can hardly spend less than literally nothing, but this isn't about adding quality as much as keeping the quality you have. \"Arsenal suffered after they moved to their stadium,\" Pochettino says. \"They struggled to keep their best players. I hope that will not happen here.\"","What Pochettino has accomplished in five years at Tottenham, blending tactical insights, motivational mastery and a dollop of magic, has been remarkable. But the standings function by wins, losses and draws, not expectations exceeded. The unavoidable question is whether the third-best team in England can keep the best striker in the world. History is skeptical. The reigning Ballon d'Or winner, Luka Modric, played at Tottenham until 2012, when he was lured away by Real Madrid. A year later, Gareth Bale left for the same team in what was at the time the most lucrative football transfer in history. \"That chance to wear that white shirt of Real Madrid, quadruple your wage bill, win Champions League titles,\" says Sherwood. \"It's hard to turn down.\"","Kane's rise has coincided with that of Pochettino, the mercurial manager who has elevated Tottenham since his arrival in 2014. \"We both want the same things,\" said Kane. \"We both want to push and push and push, and work and work.\" OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images","Now Madrid is after Kane, by all accounts. The forces of battle are lining up predictably. On one side is loyalty to his lifelong club, and the immeasurable comfort of staying near home and his extended family. On the other is a sizable raise from his $13 million annual salary, coupled with the opportunity to play for a club successful enough to satisfy Kane's ambition to keep getting better even when he's already best. Real Madrid is suffering through its worst season in a generation, but an early Champions League exit is likely to push the team that has won the competition four times in the last five years to spend freely to return to a level of prominence that its supporters expect. \"It would be a wrench for him to leave Tottenham and go somewhere else,\" Sherwood acknowledges. \"He certainly wouldn't go anywhere else in the Premier League. If he goes anywhere, it would be Real Madrid. He's a Real Madrid kind of player.\"","Kane refuses to look down the road. \"It's something you assess along the way,\" he says. Still, it's hard to imagine someone who identifies with a six-time Super Bowl champion remaining satisfied with a team that merely outperforms its wage bill. \"A lot of people look at it and say this is maybe the best team we've had, maybe the best team we'll ever have, and the best manager, but it's important that we have something to show for it,\" he acknowledges. \"It's not just, when we look back in 10 years, we had a great team. It's, 'Look what they did. Look what they won.' The challenge for us is, can we keep going up and up and up? It's going to be difficult in the next couple of years with the stadium and the finances.\"","When Pochettino arrived in the summer of 2014, he inherited two expensive strikers, Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor. It didn't take long for him to realize that Kane would be his centerpiece. \"He was improving and growing,\" Pochettino says. \"We couldn't stop him. The moment that we started to work with him, he was so open to learn and improve. We just had to give him the space to show his quality and start to play, and he started to score goals and be fantastic.\"","Since then, their fortunes have been intertwined. \"The journey at Spurs really started for me and him at the same time,\" Kane says. The presence of Kane, who signed a six-year contract extension last year, has fortified Pochettino against the advances of other clubs-including Real Madrid. Pochettino has also fielded at least preliminary inquiries from other teams, and linked with jobs from Manchester to, yes, Madrid. Seeing him commit to Spurs through 2023 helps Kane keep the faith. \"We both want the same things,\" Kane says. \"We both want to push and push and push, and work and work.\" But then he feels compelled to add, \"We'll just have to see what happens this season, and go from there.\"","It's not just Tottenham that gets the best of Kane. He has 21 goals in 36 appearances for England and is at the core of the Three Lions' resurgence under Gareth Southgate. Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images","There's no dispute that Kane is known best for scoring goals. He had six of them in last summer's World Cup, enough to win the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer. Under Pochettino, he has scored 143 goals in the Premier League and Europe, more than a third of the team's total despite the lack of any other consistent threat to relieve marking pressure.","Not satisfied with being just a finisher, Kane has made himself into a No. 9 who plays like a No. 10, which happens to be his jersey number, or occasionally even a central midfielder. For someone with Kane's build and skill set, it's an impressive achievement. \"People have this kind of old-fashioned view of an English No. 9 to be big and strong, and hold the ball up and flick it on, and they can finish as well,\" Kane says. \"I can do that, but that's not my game. My game is a mixture of things. Dropping deep, creating space, passing. When games are going not that well, you can do other things to help your team other than just shooting.\"","These days, Spurs players will confirm, Kane is the most accomplished passer on the team. \"Watch him when he drops a little deeper into midfield and holds off some stronger defenders,\" says Craig Burley, the former Chelsea and Derby County player and Scottish international who now commentates for ESPN. \"Then he sprays a 40- or 50-yard pass across the field, and it's about 10 feet above the ground at all times and usually right on the spot.\"","\"He has the quality and the brains to operate in different areas,\" adds Jan Vertonghen, who has seen Kane evolve since joining Spurs in 2012. Still, Vertonghen prefers to see him playing in the box and not just because that's where the goals come from. If Kane's there, it means the ball is getting through. It's only when it isn't that he goes foraging for it.","Kane's delight in confounding expectations may take him even further afield. When he's done with this kind of football, he doesn't see why he can't try the other kind, maybe after a year or two in MLS as a segue. He enjoys America, and his obsession with Brady has led to a fascination with all things NFL. Out of the Tottenham lineup with a bad ankle, he flew to Atlanta to watch the Patriots win the Super Bowl. Then Brady, who has been corresponding with Kane on social media, invited him to the team party.  \"We'd kind of become friends but had never met,\" Kane says. \"It was a bit strange. I hadn't been a fan of any team since I was young and supporting Tottenham.\"","Kane is convinced that his knack for placing a ball just where he wants to can be extrapolated to place-kicking, as it was in the late 1990s for former Spurs forward Clive Allen in NFL Europe. \"That's real,\" he insists. \"Something that in 10 or 12 years I definitely want to try.\"  It wouldn't be for the fame, and the contract of an NFL kicker would pay him a fraction of what he'd get scoring goals a few more years in Dubai or China. \"It goes back to that drive to be the best,\" he says. \"Even if I download a game on my phone, can I be the best in the world?\" The incentive isn't just to compete against other kickers, he reveals, but everyone who ever laced up a pair of athletic shoes. \"If you play in the Premier League and the World Cup and you then play in the NFL,\" he wonders, \"would you then be considered one of the greatest sportsmen ever?\"","He's serious, but don't go buying one of the Kane NFL jerseys on sale at the new Spurs team shop just yet. Pochettino likes to tell his players that football takes you where it wants to. It's his way of reminding them not to make grand plans, to live in the moment, because life will surprise them. \"Football is so dynamic,\" he says. Maybe Spurs will win the Champions League this year (it's far from inconceivable, especially with Real Madrid out) and become the next Manchester City, and Kane will stay forever and become iconic, the club's Raul, its Beckenbauer, its Iniesta. Or maybe they flame out in the quarterfinals, fall behind Arsenal and Chelsea and out of the top four, and fade back into midtable, West Ham with a better stadium. Would Pochettino turn down Real Madrid at that point? Would Kane?","\"You can't fight against your destiny,\" Pochettino says, answering a question about Kane's future. What that means, he has no idea. But he wants to make the point that it isn't a question of logic or even always free will, so predictions are foolish. He stops for a moment to consult with Jesus Perez, his assistant manager, to get the translation of an Argentine proverb just right. Finally, he has it. \"You can try,\" he says. \"But you can't block out the sun with your hands.\"","Welcome to the 2018 FC 100","Sam Borden: In search of Emiliano Sala","Wright Thompson: The greatest game never played","Tragedy in the Vulture's nest: The deadly fire at Flamengo","More Stories"],"targetCaptions":[]}

For one thing, we have learned that the report is nearly 400 pages long; so far, we have only seen 76 words from the report, or less 0.1% of the report.","House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)","On Friday, March 29, Attorney-General William Barr wrote to Congress saying that his ongoing redactions of the Mueller Report will take until mid-April, ignoring the request of Jerrold Nadler, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, that he release the full report to Congress by April 2.","In prior cases, like the Jaworski report in 1974 and the Starr report in 1998, the full reports were transmitted in Congress unredacted, including grand jury testimony, within a few days of completion. (Leon Jaworski was a \"special prosecutor\" while Kenneth Starr was an \"independent counsel\" and Robert Mueller is a \"special counsel\", reflecting the different time period and relevant legislation of their appointment. The terms have the same fundamental meaning and objective, namely, lawyers appointed to investigate, and potentially prosecute, suspected wrongdoing for which a conflict of interest exists for the usual prosecuting authority.)","Barr also sought in his letter of March 29 to clarify that his much-criticized letter to Congress of March 24 that appeared to summarize the conclusions of the Mueller Report was not intended to be an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsels investigation or report.","In his letter of March 24, Barr had suggested two categories of information that needed to be redacted:","In his letter of March 29, Barr added two new categories of redactions:","All but the first of these four categories are problematic.","This is not how things are meant to happen, said Professor Neil Katyal, Professor of National Security Law at Georgetown University Law Center and former Acting Solicitor General of the United States, who drafted the special counsel regulations, on MSNBC on March 29.","Neal Katyal (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)","In connection with Barrs unwillingness to release the unredacted report to Congress, Katyal said: The fact that he wont do that is really suspicious and tells me that there is information in the Mueller Report that Barr doesnt want to come out. I dont think its for up-and-up reasons. I think its because its embarrassing to the president.","Although the president had earlier indicated that he favored releasing the report, on Friday evening March 29, Trump hinted in a tweet that since the Democrats never have enough, maybe the Mueller report should not be released.","Trump tweet of March 29, 2019","On March 30, Chairman Nadler reiterated his insistence on having the full report to Congress by April 2, along with an offer to collaborate with Barr in getting a release from the judge to share grand jury testimony. House Democrats have suggested that they may subpoena the report if it is not delivered to Congress coming week.","Meanwhile, the president and his supporters have repeatedly and incorrectly stated the Mueller report is a full and total exoneration. That is not what Barrs letter of March 24 says. Barr's letter explicitly states that the Mueller report does not exonerate the president. Even the quoted words that the Mueller report did not establish a conspiracy constitute only a fragment of a sentence. We dont yet know what proviso or finding preceded those quoted words.","Barrs much-criticized conclusion that there was no obstruction-of-justice crime is an unprecedented intervention into the investigation, by someone whom Democrats believe only got the job of Attorney General by presenting a memo to the president that a president could not in principle obstruct justice. Barr's intervention thus further politicizes a process that was intended to be apolitical.","Meanwhile, as Republicans celebrated Barrs summary of the unpublished Mueller Report and called for Adam Schiffs resignation as Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff himself gave a powerful account of why the many missteps by President Trump and his associates in respect of Russia were not ok. He declared: I dont think its okay. I think its immoral. I think its unethical. I think its unpatriotic. And yes, I think its corrupt.He concluded his epic rebuttal by declaring that if it ever became accepted that these actions were ok, it would demonstrate that America had lost its way.","On March 28, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi declared in a press conference: No, thank you, Mr. Attorney General, we do not need your interpretation. Show us the report and we can draw our own conclusions. We dont need you interpreting for us. It was condescending. It was arrogant and it wasnt the right thing to do.","And read also:","Did Mueller Change His Mind About Collusion?","What The Mueller Report Will Say","Mueller Exposes Putins Hold Over Trump","Why The Trump Organization Now Risks Being Charged As A Criminal Enterprise","Steve Dennings most recent book is The Age of Agile (HarperCollins, 2018)","My new book, \"The Age of Agile\" was published by HarperCollins in 2018.

The godown allegedly belongs to a local DMK functionary Poonjolai Srinivasan. According to sources in the I-T department, the search is still in progress in DMK functionary Perumal's house and the residence of Aakar Ali, the personal assistant of DMK Treasurer Durai Murugan. Pictures of the seized cash, which exceeds Rs 10 crore, show that bundles of new currency notes of various denominations were stuffed inside gunny sacks, big shopping bags and cardboard boxes. I-T officials believe that the cash may have been intended for distribution to voters.","The Chief Electoral Officer of TN Satyabrata Sahoo, meanwhile, said that the search was conducted based on the information received by the District Electoral Officer of Vellore. Stating that a report will be given to the Election Commission if the seized money is related to the polls, CEO Satyabrata Sahoo said that appropriate action will be taken by the Election Commission based on the report submitted by the Income Tax department.","The seizure comes just days I-T officials started raiding senior DMK leader Durai Murugans properties. Both I-T and EC officials arrived at 10 pm on Friday, March 29, at Durai Murugans house and college, when a scuffle broke out over who had jurisdiction to conduct the raids. Finally, I-T raids began around 3 am on Saturday, March 30.","Many reports stated that the cash was shifted from a college that was part of Duraimurugan Educational Trust, to the godown. Satyabrata Sahoo told the media, \"We need to see if this money is connected to any party or candidate. We have nodetails of the seizure from the Income-tax department.\"","According to sources, I-T officials will be looking into whether the cash was stored by any of the parties or candidates contesting from Vellore. While the DMK is fielding senior leader Durai Murugans son Kathir Anand, the AIADMK+ candidate is Puthiya Needhi Katchi founder AC Shanmugam. The businessman is the chancellor of the Dr MGR Educational and Research Institute. TTV Dhinakarans AMMK has nominated Pandurangan to contest from the seat while R Suresh will represent Kamal Haasans Makkal Needhi Maiam in the constituency.","Meanwhile, Kathir Anands lawyer pleaded in Madras High Court on Monday that the Income Tax departments raids are obstructing Kathir Anand from campaigning in his constituency for the upcoming polls. Stating that Kathir Anand has been detained illegally by the Income Tax officials and that it was against democratic principles, the advocate requested the court to intervene in the matter. The judges said that the court would hear it on Tuesday if the parties file a petition regarding the issue.","(This is a developing story)"],"targetCaptions":[]}

He cheats at the highest level. He cheats when people are watching and he cheats when they arent. He cheats whether you like it or not. He cheats because thats how he plays golf  if youre playing golf with him, hes going to cheat.","Reilly, a former Sports Illustrated columnist who has played with Trump in the past, spoke to dozens of players  both amateur and professional  to recount some of the presidents worst cons on the course, starting with his declared handicap of 2.8.","In laymans terms, the lower the handicap, the better the player. Jack Nicklaus, winner of a record 18 major golf titles and generally considered the greatest golfer in the history of the game, has a handicap of 3.4.","Nicklaus handicap is listed on the same Golf Handicap and Information Network website used by Trump, where players post their scores.","If Trump is a 2.8, writes Reilly, Queen Elizabeth is a pole vaulter.","Shortly after he became president, Trump played with Tiger Woods, the current world No. 1 Dustin Johnson and the veteran PGA Tour pro Brad Faxon. Given the quality and profile of his companions, you might have thought Trump would have been on his best behavior. Not so.","On one hole, Trump dunked a shot into the lake, but as his opponents werent looking he simply dropped another ball  and then hit that into the water, too.","So he drives up and drops where he shouldve dropped the first time and hits it on the green, recalls Faxon.","The actor Samuel L. Jackson has also witnessed the underhanded methods Trump employs, according to Reilly.","We clearly saw him hook a ball into a lake at Trump National [Bedminster, New Jersey], he says, and his caddy told him he found it!","The boxer Oscar De La Hoya and rocker Alice Cooper have also seen the same shenanigans first hand, while LPGA player Suzann Pettersen, another victim, thinks its all down to his caddy since no matter how far into the woods he hits the ball, its in the middle of the fairway when we get there.","And Trump doesnt just tamper with his own balls.","During a game with Mike Tirico before Trump was elected, the former ESPN football announcer hit the shot of his life, a 230-yard 3-wood towards an elevated green he couldnt see. But he knew it was close.","When he got to the putting green, however, Tiricos ball was nowhere to be seen. Instead, it was 50 feet left of the hole in a bunker.","It made no sense  until Trumps caddy caught up with him after the round.","Trumps caddy came up to me and said, You know that shot you hit on the par 5? Tirico says. It was about 10 feet from the hole. Trump threw it in the bunker. I watched him do it.","Even Trumps golf courses lie. As the owner of 14 golf clubs and with his name on another five, Trump has, according to Reilly, been known to wildly exaggerate their standing in course rankings, overvalue them and even play fast and loose with their locations.","At Trump Washington at Lowes Island, theres a Civil War monument (bearing Trumps name, obviously) between the 14th and 15th holes, reminding golfers of how many soldiers, from North and South, died at that very spot.","Its a nice touch, even though several Civil War historians have confirmed that no battle took place anywhere near the memorial.","And what about his course at Bedminster? Theres a plaque there with a quote from the renowned course architect Tom Fazio.","It reads:","This is the best design Ive ever done.","TOM FAZIO","Except thats not true, either.","I dont believe I said it exactly like that, Fazio told Reilly.","In a game where etiquette is everything, Reilly reports that Trump never takes his cap off for the end-of-round handshake, nor does he remove it in the clubhouse afterward, presumably for fear of what damage a sweaty round might have done to that hairstyle.","Hes even been known to drive his golf cart onto the putting green, an offense Reilly likens to hanging your laundry in the Sistine Chapel.","Quite why Trump cheats is another matter. He is, by all accounts, a very good golfer for his age (even Tiger Woods was impressed) but seems incapable of playing by the rules. Does he even care?","To that, Reilly offers a simple reply.","Golf, he writes, is like bicycle shorts. It reveals a lot about a man.","Share this:","Share this article:","Share this:","Read Next","Texas state trooper recovering after he was shot by civili...","Read Next","Texas state trooper recovering after he was shot by civili...","Share Selection","Trending Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton NYPost.com","This story has been shared 8,637 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8,637","This story has been shared 7,503 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,503","This story has been shared 6,426 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6,426","Now On\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow on Page Six","SEE ALL","Video","Motorcyclist panics and painfully dumps his ride","Now On\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow on Decider","SEE ALL","More Stories","page six","'View' tell-all author says Rosie O'Donnell thought Whoopi was 'checked out'","nypost","Ocasio-Cortez slams critics for mocking her voice","Post Digital Network"," 2019 NYP Holdings, Inc.

It...","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Pete Buttigieg","Breaking News Emails","He was described as \"the longest of long shots\" when he decided to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, and for good reason.","He'd been the mayor of a city whose population, at barely 100,000, ranked 167th in America, falling somewhere between Cedar Rapids and Topeka. Outside of his hometown, almost no one had ever heard of him. \"It's ludicrous,\" one pundit sniffed.","But his party was desperate to reclaim the presidency and he was convinced that once they took a look at him, Democrats would see a winner  a progressive military veteran from a deeply conservative area running on a message of generational transformation.","Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana?","Nope.","Larry Agran from Irvine, California, the last candidate before Buttigieg to attempt the audacious leap from a midsize City Hall to the White House.","Agran ran in 1992, a generation ago, when the media ecosystem was far narrower and more constricting. To compare what he endured as a candidate then to what Buttigieg has already experienced now is to recognize just how drastically that ecosystem has been revolutionized  and what that revolution has made possible.","Two months after announcing his bid, Buttigieg has already attained something akin to political celebrity status, at least with a slice of the public.","There have been viral videos to go with gushing praise from elite cultural and political figures, appearances on marquee television shows and podcasts, an online fundraising windfall and a spark of life in the early polls. He's never won public office outside of South Bend, but nearly half of Democrats nationally now know Buttigieg's name, and even if his campaign falls short in the end, he's already succeeded in making himself a mainstream national figure.","Watching this all unfold from his home in Irvine, Agran can only marvel.","To call his '92 campaign \"forgotten\" would be a misnomer; few ever knew he was running in the first place. Dismissed by the gatekeeper class as a fringe character, he found himself shunned by television, barred from debates, cropped out of newspaper photos, and even  in an incident he still grows emotional recounting  handcuffed and arrested while trying to join his fellow primary candidates on stage in New York.","\"It's very, very painful to be excluded when you know you're worthy of inclusion,\" Agran, now 74, said in an interview last week. \"That sticks with you a long time, you know. There's a certain humiliation.\"","A very different climate","Democrats were confronting a leadership vacuum when Agran first got the idea to run. The party was on a losing streak, three straight national defeats and none of its heavyweights were eager to challenge President George H.W. Bush, who seemed invincible after the Gulf War triumph of early 1991.","Momentous global change was afoot, too. The Berlin Wall was down, the Soviet empire in collapse, and the Cold War over at last. A brand new set of challenges awaited the country, and there was a debate to be had about what the priorities should be. Agran wanted in on it.","At first, he tried to play a supporting role. Former Sen. George McGovern, who'd been the Democrats' 1972 nominee against Richard Nixon, was contemplating another bid, and Agran headed his exploratory committee. But when McGovern took a pass, Agran  like Buttigieg this year  found himself surveying the field and wondering: Why not me?","Against a roster of current and former senators and governors, hed be the only mayor, an advocate for issues and ideas the other candidates weren't interested in touching. He could point to a record, six years as mayor battling developers and implementing landmark environmental ordinances in a city exploding with growth. That Irvine was a Republican town (and part of famously conservative Orange County) and that Agran had won elections there anyway might be another selling point.","He drew up a platform. The centerpiece was a \"peace dividend\"  radically slashing defense spending and using the money to deliver large payments directly to American cities. In August 1991, he held an event at the University of California-Irvine to announce his candidacy for president. \"America,\" Agran declared, \"can no longer afford the Cold War priorities of the 1980s.\"","South Bend mayor makes his case for 2020","Today, a campaign like Agran's would put videos from that speech on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets. They'd probably create a short, slick introductory video, too, aiming for viral attention. Buttigieg's 107-second announcement video, for example, has over a million views (and counting) just on his Twitter page. The online energy it generated when it was posted back in January led directly to broader media coverage of his candidacy.","But there was no social media in 1991, no internet to speak of, and only one cable news network (CNN, which was far less focused on politics than it is now). That left Agran at the mercy of a relative handful of media and political elites who could decide if he was worthy of attention on national television and in major national newspapers  and, critically, of a spot on the debate stage. Over and over again, their decision was no.","Again, the contrast to today is striking.","For the 2020 race, the Democratic National Committee has established specific and attainable criteria for inclusion in debates. Anyone who can hit 1 percent in several national polls or generate 65,000 small dollar donations can get on the stage. There's no question that Buttigieg, and probably more than a dozen others, will qualify, and the debates  all broadcast in prime time on national television  will be seen by millions of Americans.","Get on TV, or bust","When Agran ran, though, the standards were arbitrary. The chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party simply announced that \"as far as Im concerned, he's a minor candidate,\" and left Agran out. \"That was the killer in the end,\" Agran recalled, \"when I was kept out of the debates.\"","Even when Agran caught a break, there wasn't much he could do with it. By far, his best media exposure came when PBS's \"MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour\" aired a 10-minute interview with him on a Friday night. It was well-received, with Agran's campaign getting dozens of calls from viewers who wanted to learn more. But with no social media to spread it around and build buzz, the interview vanished into the ether.","Agran remembers being at a small campaign event in someone's home and being asked why he was never on television.","\"I said, 'Does someone have a VCR here?'\" Someone did, and Agran played the tape of his MacNeil/Lehrer interview. \"And after they saw me on the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour, they erupted in applause, cheering the television. I'm standing right there  and they applaud the TV appearance! Which tells me, just confirmed, that unless you break through on TV, you just can't break through.\"","Flashback 1992: Larry Agran voter at New York Democratic Primary","Frustrated, Agran ultimately tried to force his way into the action. He crashed a candidate forum in New Hampshire hosted by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, standing in the audience, explaining his credentials and asking for a seat. When the audience rallied behind him, Rockefeller relented and Agran was given a seat with the other candidates. When he tried it again a few months later during a televised debate in New York, the response was different.","\"I stood up and said, 'Mr. Chairman, I'm Larry Agran. I'm a duly qualified candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. I'm on the New York State ballot. And I respectfully request inclusion in this debate.'","\"And just as I was making my pitch, police came charging up the stairs, down the aisle, grabbed me, and I repeated  while they were grabbing me  my request. And I was just dragged down the stairs headfirst, down two flights of stairs. And they arrested me, handcuffed me, put me in a police wagon.\"","While Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown debated inside that auditorium, Agran remained in custody. He was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest (\"The only resistance was my head hitting one stair after another  and it was the stairs that were providing the resistance\"), but the charges were ultimately dropped. He stayed in the race through the Democratic convention, collecting 58,000 votes nationally and three delegates  a fraction of the 10.5 million votes and nearly 3,400 delegates won by Clinton, who became the nominee and then unseated Bush that November.","A few years later, Joshua Meyrowitz, a professor of communication at the University of New Hampshire, used the Agran campaign as a case study to explore why some candidacies are taken seriously and others aren't. \"Agran's was a campaign that often came close to the threshold between minor and major,\" he wrote, \"but there was almost nothing he could do to cross it.\"","When his presidential campaign ended, Agran returned to Irvine, led an effort to create a national urban presidential primary, and then threw himself back into local politics, even winning back the mayoralty before losing re-election in 2014.","If he'd known what he was in for, Agran now says, he probably wouldn't have run for president. But he also says he's glad there's room now for a much wider assortment of candidates to be heard  including the mayor of a midsize city in northern Indiana.","Asked if the attention that's been showered on Buttigieg  the CNN town hall, the late-night TV appearances, the social media chatter  ever makes him think, That should have been me! Agran chuckled.","\"Oh, yeah, I've thought of that a number of times.\"","CORRECTION: (March 31, 2019, 10:08 a.m., ET): An earlier version of this article misstated Pete Buttigieg's political record. He ran unsuccessfully for Indiana state treasurer in 2010; it is not the case that has never run for office outside of South Bend, Indiana.","Steve Kornacki is a national political correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC."," 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL"],"targetCaptions":[]}

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. For an explanation of our Advertising Policy, visit this page.","With tax season upon us and a new tax law in use, many Americans are anxious to know what it will mean for their tax payments  and refunds. The good news is that two-thirds of Americans can expect to pay less for the 2018 fiscal year in taxes, but the bad news is that might not translate to a bigger refund, according to The Wall Street Journal.","Tax returns vary state to state and person to person, but past data and future estimates can still give taxpayers a sense of what theyll be forking over to the IRS come April. Using data from Smart Asset on average tax refunds per state, weve come up with trip ideas for the most common tax refund amounts. And really, what better way to celebrate spring (and the end of tax season) than with a trip paid for in full with a tax refund?","You can use sites like Jauntaroo and Wander to input the type of vacation youre dreaming of (adventure or cultural; city or rural) and your individual per-person budget. Even with a smaller refund, youll be surprised how far it can take you.","$2,400 to $2,550","With a more modest tax refund, visitors can still plan an awesome trip, either domestically or abroad. The lowest tax refund is, typically, in Maine, where the average tax payer sees a refund of $2,460. But that money could send a solo traveler to Cartagena, Colombia (we found flights for $743 in May) or Berlin, Germany, for a week or longer (flights may use about half your budget, starting at $1,110). Those looking to travel domestically could take a full two weeks to visit the Pacific Northwest (think: Seattle, Portland and the surrounding area for under $500 roundtrip) or to the islands of Hawaii.","Couples can spend a week in Sedona, Arizona hiking the red rocks, or lounge on the beach in Floridas Key West, with airfares in the low $300s roundtrip from many East Coast airports, according to Jauntaroo.","International destinations are still a possibility for couples on a $2,400 budget, including getaways to Croatia, where roundtrip airfare can be found from $483 per person and hotels can be booked for less than $100 per night. (Sadly, outside the capital, there arent a ton of points hotel options.) Theres also Budapest, Hungary. Hunt for a roundtrip flight just over $400 and boutique apartment rentals for $60 per night on Airbnb.","$2,700 to $2,850","Much of the Midwest falls into this range of tax refunds, including Minnesota, Ohio and Michigan, according to Smart Asset. Residents in these states can escape still-chilly temperatures with trips to sunny and beautiful destinations all across the US  especially cities with some of the best art, culture and food scenes. For a lower-budget trip, US residents can head to New Orleans (fly Spirit and you could go for under $200 from major Midwest airports) to sample alligator sausage and listen to hot jazz or to Charleston (we found flights costing between $260 and $420 in May, depending on your departure airport) for contemporary Southern cuisine and charming colonial architecture.","For international vacations, Midwest residents can head to Spain from the Midwest for just $481 roundtrip per person, or take a quick flight to the island of Aruba for just $371, according to Skyscanner. Entire families can enjoy a trip here by using points to reserve a stay at one of the islands many great points properties.","$3,000 to $3,150","The average tax refund has historically been about $3,000 per person, and most states land in this range, from Alaska to Georgia, Maryland and Nevada. Its still a sizable refund, and even travelers who dont want to spend their entire tax refund on a trip can find great options within this budget.","For residents of Nevada, Alaska, or any of the other western states, the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington are a short flight and boat ride away. The rural archipelago is filled with state parks and greenery, making it the perfect option for nature lovers who want to hike, kayak, swim or watch for orcas starting in May. Flights originating from the west can be as low as $103 per person, according to Skyscanner, and hotels on the islands usually run from $70 to $150 per night.","For international locations, residents of the West Coast can fly to parts of South America in just a few hours. Flights from California to Sao Paulo, Brazil are usually less than $500 in May. East Coast residents can turn to the British Isles for a great getaway, where flights to Scotland are $499 round trip and flights to London are just $341, according to Skyscanner. Travelers can splurge on the recently renovated Ritz-Carlton in London, or stay at the highly rated Hilton Metropole for less than $150 per night. (Cash in your points for an award night, and youll have plenty of your refund left over for food, beverages and activities.)","$3,700 to $3,850","States in the Northeast see some of the highest average tax refunds, with Connecticut taking the number one spot of $3,844, according to Smart Asset. Travelers could jet off to Bali for two weeks to visit ancient Hindu temples. Flights from New York City to Bali can get as low as $481 roundtrip in the month of May (though if you want to book something quick, its not difficult to find flights in the mid-$700s) and hotels run in the low hundreds per night.","North African temperatures tend to be relatively mild in the spring, making it a great time to visit Morocco or Egypt (one of our top places to travel this April). Flights to Africa tend to run on the more expensive side, regardless of the time of year, but flights to Casablanca can be found in the low $600s roundtrip. Visitors can rent entire homes near Casablanca for roughly $50 per night  and some even include their own pools.","This story has been edited to clarify that it refers to tax refunds, not tax returns.","For the latest travel news, deals and points and miles tips pleasesubscribe to The Points Guy daily email newsletter.","Feature imageby spxChrome / Getty Images.","Share this:","News and deals straight to your inbox every day.","SIGN-UP BONUS: 50,000 Miles","TPG'S BONUS VALUATION: $700","CARD HIGHLIGHTS: 10X miles on stays booked and paid for through Hotels.com/Venture + 2x miles on everything else.

They really dont need anything else to beat the Liberals.","WATCH: Prime Minister in campaign mode in B.C.","Indeed, the only province in which the Liberals are in pole position is Quebec, where they have the support of 38 per cent of respondents.","However, the Conservatives (25 per cent) and Bloc Quebecois (23 per cent) appear to have enough strength to prevent the Liberals from truly taking advantage of their Quebec share as they did in 2015.","The NDP, with only 12 per cent of the vote support, is poised to lose most if not all of its seats in Quebec.But its not the Liberals who stand to gain from Quebecers deserting the NDP, Bricker said.","These are not people who are Liberal-NDP switchers. These are probably Bloc Quebecois voters who couldnt vote Bloc last time because of all the problems they were having, combined with people who voted for the Coalition Avenir Quebec, Bricker said.","WATCH: NDP faces steep incumbency disadvantage","Compounding the Liberals misery is the fact that their leader is now bleeding support among some of the core constituencies that helped sweep him to power in 2015.","Forty per cent of women now say they would vote Conservative, compared to just 28 per cent for the Liberals (the Tories enjoy a similar lead among men).","Among younger voters aged 18 to 34, the Conservatives (34 per cent) hold a slight lead over the Liberals (31 per cent).","The only key subset among which the Liberals lead is the university-educated, with 44 per cent approval compared to 30 per cent for Conservatives.","Whats happened is that the brand that Trudeau had  he had a strong appeal among young people, and there was a gender gap that worked in his favour  all seems to be gone, Bricker said.","Indeed, Trudeaus individual approval rating as prime minister now sits at 40 per cent, three points lower than that of Trump in the U.S.","In spite of all the issues that theyve had to deal with in the United States, the likelihood that the president of the United States will get re-elected is higher right now than the prime minister [of Canada] being re-elected, Bricker said.","Trudeaus 40 per cent rating is also lower than that of former prime minister Stephen Harper at this stage in 2015, with Harper having a 47 per cent rating in April 2015.","READ MORE: Almost half of Americans still believe Trump colluded with Russia, according to Reuters/Ipsos poll","Furthermore, any hopes that the Liberals might have had about the federal budget prompting a rebound in their fortunes appear to have dissipated, the poll suggests.","Asked how they felt about Budget 2019, 64 per cent of Canadians said they were indifferent, a figure that includes 67 per cent of Liberal supporters.Twenty-five per cent said the budget was bad, while 11 per cent said it was good.","There are only a certain number of cards a government can play, and the single biggest one is the budget, particularly a pre-election budget, Bricker said.Youre hoping that youre going to get noticed, youre going to get on the radar, that this is going to contrast you with your opponents.","The worst outcome you can have is that they hate the budget, and the second-worst is that they ignore it  and they ignored it.","WATCH: Scheer calls Liberal spending plan most expensive cover-up in history of cover-ups","If the source of many of the Liberal Partys woes is the SNC-Lavalin scandal, thats also where they need to look for solutions to turn their situation around, Bricker said.","The first thing Trudeau has to recognize is that what hes doing now isnt working, he said.If this is the strategy  to go on, day by day, fighting it out with his opponents in his own caucus and dealing with the media the way that he has  its not working.","Every day, its getting a little bit worse.","ANALYSIS: Biggest peril for Team Trudeau is that Liberals are at war with each other","Bricker said its high time Trudeau thinks about allowing former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott to speak out about the SNC-Lavalin affair.","Even if theyve got some bad things to say about the way things were handled, how much worse could the damage be than what [the Liberals] are already taking? said Bricker.","Every day that it goes on, it just confirms peoples worst fears If theres a really good story that the government has and its not going to be as damaging as what the two dissident former ministers are going to say, youd better let them talk.","This isnt going away.","WATCH: Ethics Committee rejects opposition call for new SNC-Lavalin probe","Despite the Conservatives strong current position, Bricker says Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer will eventually need to do more than simply put his feet up and watch the Liberal Party implode under the weight of SNC-Lavalin.","At some point, people are going to turn to the question of, OK, if not Justin Trudeau, what does his likely replacement look like? and Scheers going to have to be ready to be able to respond to both the hopes and the fears that Canadians would have about him, Bricker said.","READ MORE: Scheer says Liberals used federal budget as a political prop","The truth is that, at the moment, Canadians dont really know anything about him.","Its going to be an interesting test when the lights turn on and the cameras turn his way, how hes going to be able to respond.

The iconic filmmaker loves his Facebook account, and regularly posts about current events and other things. And more times than not, his takes are the very definition of hot. So, you better believe people perked up and took notice when Schrader talked about Jordan Peeles recent comments about white male leads.","READ MORE:Paul Schrader Talks Streaming Vs. Theaters & Explains Why Hes Happy Netflix Passed On First Reformed","For those that missed the big news, Peele recently spoke at an event and said that he didnt see himself working with a white male lead in the future. He said, I dont see myself casting a white dude as the lead in my movie. Not that I dont like white dudes, but Ive seen that movie.","Needless to say, given that its 2019 and every word a famous person says gets analyzed, especially if race is involved, the opinions about Peeles statements were polarized. Well, Schrader decided to chime in and give his thoughts on the matter, and while the sentiment is there, his word choice is a bitlacking.","The filmmaker wrote, This makes sense. Ive written or directed films with a black lead, an oriental lead, a female lead but my natural identification is with a certain type of white male. Peele at some point will find himself directing a white lead, not because of commerce but simply because thats how art works.","READ MORE:Paul Schrader Escapes Facebook Jail & Talks De Niros Desire For A Taxi Driver Sequel: Stupidest Fking Idea Ive Ever Heard","Of course, Schrader is an older gentleman and not aware that the term oriental is deemed as not appropriate. At least, lets hope so. But otherwise, the filmmaker understands and empathizes with Peele, although he thinks that eventually, the Get Out filmmaker will have to eat those words.","Well just have to wait and see if Peele ends up regretting those words and uses a white male lead in the future. At this point, it appears the filmmaker is more than happy to spend his time producing films and creating projects that focus on whatever he wants. And right now, what he wants is to use Black leads.

I think we can all agree that by any meaningful definition the guy is pretty smart. It's also obvious he has a talent for surrounding himself with other smart people who can help make his vision reality.","How does he find them? It's a question he addressed when he stopped by the Basecamp offices a few years ago, the company's founder, Jason Fried, reportson the Basecamp blog. And the answer Bezos gave was the exact opposite of what most folks would expect.","Smart people are actually wrong a lot.","Most of us, when we want to figure out if someone is smart, ask if the person is frequently right:Do they have correct knowledge about the world and their area of expertise? Do they come up with the right answers when faced with hard problems? Do their predictions turn out to be right?","But Bezos's counterintuitive strategy isn't just to look at how often people are right. Instead, he also looks for people who can admit they are wrong and change their opinions often.","Bezos has \"observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they'd already solved. They're open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking,\"Fried reports the Amazon boss saying.","\"Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\"","That willingness to consider new information goes hand in hand with a willingness to admit your old way of thinking was flawed. In other words, to be super smart you have to change your mind a lot. EssayistRalph WaldoEmerson famously said, \"Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\"Bezos apparently agrees that consistency is overrated.","\"He doesn't think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait,\" Fried reports. \"It's perfectly healthy--encouraged, even--to have an idea tomorrow that contradicts your idea today.\"","It's not just 19th-century philosophers who agree with Bezos. Modern science does too, although psychologists have a less poetic way of speaking about the flexibility of mind Bezos prizes. They call it intellectual humility. Studies of decision making show that people who are more willing to entertain the idea that they're wrong make markedly better choices. Being wrong, they understand, isn't a sign of stupidity. It's a sign of curiosity, openness to new information, and ultimately smarts.","If famous essays, top CEOs, and the latest research aren't enough to convince you that to be smarter, you need to also be frequently wrong, you can also take it from the undoubtedly smart futurists at Palo Alto's Institute for the Future. According to Stanford professor Bob Sutton, they encapsulate this trait of highly intelligent folks this way: \"strong opinions, which are weakly held.\"","As the futurists explained to Sutton, weakly held (and therefore often changed) opinions are importantbecause they mean you aren't \"too attached to what you believe,\" which \"undermines your ability to 'see'and 'hear'evidence that clashes with your opinions.\"","So next time you're trying to determine if someone is actually super smart or simply bluffing, don't ask whether they're always right. Instead, ask when was the last time they changed their opinion. If they can't name lots of times they were wrong, they're probably not as smart as they want to appear."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Play long games of chess, stop eating sugar, meditate and listen to binaural beats.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Note that some of the items in this list will help you immediately, while some will take a few weeks to have a noticeable effect on your concentration.","1. Sleep for 8  9 hours a day:","This is probably the single most important thing when it comes to having a high amount of concentration. You cannot really hold your attention if youre feeling drowsy, can you?","You need to sleep for at least 8 hours a day.","Your body needs sleep to rest, clear waste from the brain, consolidate memories for long term storage, heal and grow your muscles etc  it does not make sense to skimp on sleep.","Dont fall into the I only sleep 6 hours a day hype. Youre not a teenager and being chronically underslept is not cool and hip.","Youre only hurting yourself by not getting sleep.","Ive used this quote in the same context before:","If I had 8 hours to chop down a tree, I would spend 6 of those hours sharpening my axe.  Abraham Lincoln","Youve got 24 hours.","Spend the first 8 sharpening your brain  theres literally no reason not to.","2. Fix your diet and STOP EATING SUGAR:","Your brain and body need high quality food to function optimally.","You need to stop eating processed garbage such as vegetable oil,refined grains, instant noodles, and the worst culprit of all: refined sugar.","The problem with processed food is that theyre full of simple carbohydrates and empty calories  they mess up your hormones, they make you fat, and they dont provide your body with efficient energy.","Filling up on processed carbohydrates is like running a car on kerosene  itll work, but it wont be nearly as smooth and will damage the engine given enough time.","Substitute your vegetable oil with ghee or butter.","Avoid sugar as much as possible.","Sugar is *terrible* for your brain.","Sugar slows your brain down.","Sugar impairs your memory and learning skills.","Sugar gives you a mental haze (commonly known as brain fog).","Sugar causes insulin tolerance which then causes long term cognitive decline and even dementia.","(When I say sugar, I dont mean natural sugars like the ones found in fruits, I mean factory made refined sugar  which you find in cake, candy bars, soft drinks etc.)","Stop putting refined sugar in your food.","The absolute dumbest thing I see people do is put sugar in their morning coffee.","Starting your day with a sugary drink is the worst thing you can do for alertness and focus.","Always have your coffee with no sugar. Youll get used to the not-so-sweet taste in a few days at max.","3. Plan what you need to do ahead of time:","You need to plan what you want to do and how much you want to do in advance.","Lets say youre a student. Dont just get down and say Ill study for two hours.","Instead, mark two hours worth of material and say Ill get up once Im done with this.","Youll have much higher drive to get it done because you now have a specific goal in mind that you cant cheat on by being distracted.","Setting measurable goals is half the game.","Its easy to say I studied for 2 hours when you spent 1.5 hours of those daydreaming.","Its not so easy when you actually have to complete 2 hours worth of material before you get up.","I recommend creating a detailed to-do list every night, where you outline timespans for the various tasks you need to complete.","For things like studying and work, youll also mark out reasonable goals that you plan to meet in that time frame.","Youll find that your concentration automatically increases as your brain knows how much it has to do, instead of just knowing that it has to abstractly do something.","4. Make your surroundings comfortable:","Make sure your chair and table are comfortable (its much harder to work on a hard chair) and see to it that you have a bottle of water close to you.","Make sure that the temperature of the room is right  its easy to get distraced if youre feeling too hot or too cold.","Youll also find it easier to focus in a place youre familiar with  your room is infinitely better than say, a coffee shop.","5. Play some soft music:","Play any soft, repetitive music. Repetitive music helps your brain focus.","Keep the volume low because its supposed to be going on in the background, not the foreground.","And pick music that doesnt have lyrics. Lyrics are distracting because your brain is attuned to process speech immediately upon hearing it.","I recommend listening to Binaural Beats.","6. Meditate:","While youll certainly notice some immediate improvement in focus after you meditate, meditation is a long term game.","Youll have to meditate for at least a month or two to really start seeing the results of the exercise.","Meditation is one of the most important things you can do to make your brain more stable  it literally increases the size of your brain, makes your prefrontal cortex (part of brain that handles decision making) stronger, and the emotional centers of the brain less volatile.","I recommend starting out with 5 minutes a day and over the period of a few weeks, increasing it to 15-20 minutes a day.","7. Lift Weights:","This is another long term way to improve your focus.","Lifting improves your overall physical and mental health.","Studies show that resistance training improves memory, slows the progress of dementia and boosts cognition.","It will also bring your hormones in line, and help you beat the desire for instant gratification, which in turn makes it more likely that you wont get distracted  can you see how everything is connected?","8. Play long games of chess:","This is a fun one  once a week, you should play a 3 hour long game of chess.","You ideally want to play it with a smart friend whos pursuing the same goals of self-improvement as you, but playing over the internet is fine too.","When youre playing, dont play quickly. Remember, were trying to develop our concentration.","Take your time and carefully calculate lots of lines through the game.","This is fun and will train your brain to sit still and think for an extended period of time.","Focus, just like a lot of things, comes down to practice.","9. Stop using social media so damn much:","Social media is junk food for your brain.","Just like how junk food messes up your body, social media messes up your brain.","The way this works is that social media trains your brain to superficially go through material quickly  this destroys your ability to read slowly and go in depth.","Social media also trains your brain to expect something new and interesting every few seconds (a new Facebook status, a new Instagram photo etc)  and eventually, you lose your ability to concentrate on boring things that dont give you a hit of dopamine 10 times a minute.","The best way to deal with Facebook and Instagram is to delete them (unless theyre helping you get paid!).","Remember, in the world of non-existent attention spans and distractions, the man who can focus and get work done is king.","Hope this helps,","Your Man,","Harsh Strongman","Work on Fix Your Life is underway!","RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","How to Sleep Better And Deeper","Three Types of Hobbies That You Should Have","How to be Good Looking as a Man","6 COMMENTS","What do I do instant messaging app?","Turn off notifications and check it twice a day.","What do I do instant messaging app?","Thanks thats an added one .","I freeze the app and set timer for when and how long I will check it.","Thanks","Another good post.","In my opinion point number 9 is the most important one, as its one where very smart people have monetised your attention via dopamine addiction via apps and websites. I have dealt with this for years, and have finally broken its back by limiting my access to the web, especially on my phone.","On my Android phone Ive disabled the browser and YouTube apps. I have no social media, other than WhatsApp, which is only used with my family. If I want to access the internet, I have to deliberately make time on a desktop. This is not nearly as inconvenient as it might sound. Making web use deliberate has a strong impact to how much time is wasted, and I only use it when I actually *need* to. Nothing bad has happened and I am no longer distracted to the same level.","Learning to meditate is great (I have done it daily for years) but things like that wont help much if you are surrounded by such powerful, deliberately designed distractions. One of my new hobbies is looking around in restaurants for people *not* glued to their phones. It can start to seem like a zombie film at times.","For those that havent heard of him, Cal Newport is the godfather of this approach to tech and has just released a book, Digital Minimalism, on the subject of only using tech intentionally.","NoSurf is also good: https://nosurf.org/","Hi,  just using Twitter, and I follow redpill writer, some tech blog, science blog and you of course  But when I look to following part I see 75 account.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), the social media star and self-identified democratic socialist, is fairly unpopular around the country.","A Quinnipiac poll released on Thursday morning found that 23 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the member of Congress, while 36 percent had an unfavorable view  a -13 overall approval rating. Thirty-eight percent hadnt heard enough about her to have an informed opinion.","This new poll isnt a one-off finding. Three prior surveys  one in January from Morning Consult, one in February from Fox, and a third in mid-March from Gallup  all found that more Americans had negative views of AOC than had positive ones. This might surprise a lot of Democrats, who see all of her viral clips and impressive performances in congressional hearings and assume shes a popular rising star.","So whats going on? Ocasio-Cortez herself has a preferred explanation  that shes been vilified on Fox News and in other conservative outlets, and theyve driven her national approval rating down. If this theory is right, then youd expect her negative favorables to be driven almost entirely by Republicans detesting her and everyone else not being as familiar with her.","And that appears to be exactly what is happening.","How conservative media is dragging down AOCs poll numbers","If you look at the detailed breakdown of the latest poll, from Quinnipiac, youll see that Ocasio-Cortez is viewed extremely favorably among Democrats: 47 percent view her favorably and 7 percent view her unfavorably. By contrast, shes viewed overwhelmingly unfavorably among Republicans: A scant 2 percent view her favorably while 74 percent view her unfavorably.","The most striking partisan gap is how many people in each party are familiar with her.","A large number of Democrats  44 percent  havent heard enough about her to have an opinion. A much smaller percentage of Republicans  23 percent  can say the same. AOC is simply better known among Republicans than Democrats, and this is driving her unfavorables up.","There are a number of reasons why this could be the case. Her overall political message is pretty polarizing, and its not surprising that this would turn off Republicans especially. But disproportionate attention to her in conservative media seems to be a major part of the story.","The Washington Posts Phillip Bump analyzed Fox News segments between January 1 and February 15 of this year, comparing the number of segments mentioning AOC to those focusing on at least one of the Democratic 2020 presidential candidates. It turns out she got more coverage on Fox than any candidate save one, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also a right-wing boogeyman. Ocasio-Cortez got significantly more Fox News coverage than fellow democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.","Its astonishing that a Democratic backbencher could get this much attention and get so famous at the beginning of her first term. Its a testament to how much of a phenomenon she is on the Democratic left  and how much the right seems to both hate and fear her.","In an interview with the New Yorkers David Remnick, AOC characterized all the media attention as exhausting and borderline dangerous.","Ive got a full-time job in Congress and then I moonlight as Americas greatest villain, or as the new hope. And its pretty tiring, she said. This ravenous hysteria  its really getting to a level that is kind of out of control.","Next Up In\n    \n        Politics & Policy","Most Read","Vox Sentences","The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.","The Latest","Why Crazy Ex-Girlfriends series finale was so, so satisfying","Vox Sentences: A Saudi crackdown on womens rights","America is finally being exposed to the devastating reality of prison violence","Mark Halperin says his conduct has changed.

Emphasizing that good intentions do not make inherently good acts, abreu shows how social practice artworks usually fail to make any lasting impact in the communities they supposedly serve, and stresses that aesthetics and art-market value are the wrong criteria for measuring social good. Heres an excerpt:","So the scales can tip toward harm fairly quickly, and its easy to see how social practice falls into the paradigm of what George Lipsitz calls the white spatial imaginary, where white intervention continues to present itself as an ethical act rather than as a facet of Black and Brown oppression. Were the veil of art to be taken away in Hirschhorns project, residents might see their collective activity as unpaid labor rather than as the creativity of the social made manifest. People on the street, being approached to talk about race, might see it as harassment from a stranger rather than as art. Consider one of the worst examples: In an attempt to address racism, Joe Scanlan invented a Black woman artist, rather than materially support Black women and organizations for and by Black women. Scanlans Donelle Woolford project is one of the most ethically contentious artworks of the past ten years.","More than anything, social practice reveals the strong desire for a malleable public: one that is open to be changed, that wants to participate or contribute labor, that accepts the terms of engagement, and that believes in the transformative power of Western art. The idea of a public is so fractured in this hyper-corporate, digital era that one can see where this yearning comes from, as well as the more general yearning for what people describe as art that makes a difference. But if one is simply instrumentalizing people as raw material for ones art, the art world and the capitalist powers that guide it have equal responsibility to critically and ethically evaluate the longer-term stakes. Otherwise, the do-gooder veneer falls away to reveal the same quarterly, value-focused framework we see in other sectors of capitalist markets.","Image: Thomas Hirschhorn, Gramsci Monument, 2013.

Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will know that Mjolnir has been the Asgardian's sidekick for his entire time on-screen, hence the heartbreak when it was destroyed by Hela (Cate Blanchett) in Thor: Ragnarok. Luckily for the God of Thunder, he was fortunate enough to get an all-new hammer thanks to Eitri (Peter Dinklage) in Avengers: Infinity War.","In fact, the new hammer -- Stormbreaker -- appears to dwarf the power of its predecessor. But just how powerful is it? Let's take a moment and break it down the situation down. Starting at the birth of the weapon, Stormbreaker was able to save the life of Thor, who just took the full force of a supernova star. Resurrection capabilities aside, Stormbreaker is much more than just a lifesaver.","As seen in one of the most epic entrances of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we saw that Stormbreaker also has the power to summon the Bifrost. Not only can Stormbreaker save a god from his death, but it can also summon the ability to travel anywhere across the Nine Realms at the drop of a hat. Do you think Mjolnir is sweating yet?","Now for the cherry on top...the icing on the proverbial cake. In the hand of Thor, Stormbreaker was able to take on the brunt force of all six Infinity Stones at once. Not one, not two -- but all six the universe's most powerful tools or weapons, depending on how you look at it. Not just that, it likely could have cut off the head of the Mad Titan himself (Josh Brolin), you know -- if Thor would have gone for the head.","Captain Marvel is in theaters now and will be followed up by Avengers: Endgame on April 26th.","Do you think there's another weapon more powerful than Stormbreaker in the MCU?

This is equivalent to 38 g or 9 teaspoons (tsp) of sugar.","Women","Women should use no more than 100 discretionary calories on sugar per day. This is around 25 g or 6 tsp of sugar.","Children","Children between the ages of 2 and 18 should consume no more than 25 g, or 6 tsp, of added sugar daily.","People with diabetes","Diabetes makes it difficult for the body to use glucose effectively. Since the body converts both naturally occurring and added sugars into glucose, people with diabetes must monitor their overall sugar intake.","But some foods affect blood glucose levels more than others, depending on their glycemic index (GI). Foods with a higher GI raise blood glucose more than foods with a lower GI.","A person with diabetes should regularly check their blood glucose level to ensure that it is within a safe range. This range will vary slightly from person to person.","Avoiding added sugars and focusing on consuming the right amounts of fiber and nutrient-dense carbohydrates from whole foods can help stabilize blood sugar levels.","Added sugar vs. natural sugar","Certain whole foods contain naturally occurring sugars.","For example, fruits and some vegetables contain the sugar fructose, and milk contains a sugar called lactose. These foods also contain nutrients and may be sources of dietary fiber.","Added sugars are sugars or caloric sweeteners that manufacturers put in foods or drinks.","Added sugars can be natural or chemically manufactured. A type of sugar can be \"natural\" (i.e. unprocessed) without being \"naturally occurring.\"","Examples of natural sugars that manufacturers add to provide sweetness include honey, maple syrup, and coconut sugar.","Even fructose and lactose qualify as added sugars in many processed foods.","Examples of added sugars to look for on food labels include:","How to reduce sugar intake","People can reduce their intake of added sugar by:","Avoiding liquid sugar","Liquid sugar is in soft drinks and juices. The body digests it more quickly than the sugar in foods, and as a result, liquid sugar causes a greater spike in blood glucose levels.","If a person drinks sugary liquids on a regular basis, the repeated spikes in blood glucose can overload the pancreas and liver, causing health problems.","Sodas tend to contain the highest amounts of liquid sugar. A 12-ounce can of soda contains about 8 tsp of sugar, or 130 empty calories.","The following drinks may also contain liquid sugar:","Avoiding packaged foods","Research suggests that about 75 percent of packaged foods in supermarkets contain added sweeteners.","Examples of packaged foods that may contain added sugar include:","Swapping added sugars for natural alternatives","The following tips can help a person replace the added sugar in their diet with more healthful alternatives:","Trying sugar alternatives","Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) contain few or no calories.","Researchers have investigated whether replacing sugary foods and drinks with sugar-free options containing NNSs may help people consume fewer calories and maintain a healthy weight. They have reached differing conclusions.","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved the following NNSs for use in food:","Stevia is another type of NNS that the FDA consider to be \"generally recognized as safe.\" This means that experts agree that recommended amounts are safe to use.","It is best to limit the intake of NNSs and pay attention to overall calories consumed per day, as NNSs can lead to cravings and overeating.","Emerging research suggests that artificial sweeteners may have negative effects on metabolism, gut health, and cravings, but confirming these findings will require more research.","Summary","The average person in the U.S. consumes an excessive amount of added sugar, and experts have linked high sugar consumption to a range of diseases.","People can reduce their health risks by cutting down on the amount of added sugar in their diet. This may require a person to carefully check food and drink labels for different forms of sugar.","People can also gain more control over their sugar intake by preparing homemade meals and snacks using fresh, whole produce.","Related coverage","Additional information","Article last reviewed by Mon 11 March 2019.Visit our Nutrition / Diet category page for the latest news on this subject, or sign up to our newsletter to receive the latest updates on Nutrition / Diet.All references are available in the References tab.","References","Added sugar infographic.

Now Scientists Know Why. https://t.co/56xD0MDgGx"],"postMedia":[],"targetTitle":"At 71, Shes Never Felt Pain or Anxiety. Now Scientists Know Why.","targetDescription":"Scientists discovered a previously unidentified genetic mutation in a Scottish woman. They hope it could lead to the development of new pain treatment.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Advertisement","Supported by","By Heather Murphy","Shed been told that childbirth was going to be painful. But as the hours wore on, nothing bothered her  even without an epidural.","I could feel that my body was changing, but it didnt hurt me, recalled the woman, Jo Cameron, who is now 71. She likened it to a tickle. Later, she would tell prospective mothers, Dont worry, its not as bad as people say it is.","It was only recently  more than four decades later  that she learned her friends were not exaggerating.","Rather, there was something different about the way her body experienced pain: For the most part, it didnt.","Scientists believe they now understand why. In a paper published Thursday in The British Journal of Anaesthesia, researchers attributed Ms. Camerons virtually pain-free life to a mutation in a previously unidentified gene. The hope, they say, is that the finding could eventually contribute to the development of a novel pain treatment. They believe this mutation may also be connected to why Ms. Cameron has felt little anxiety or fear throughout her life and why her body heals quickly.","Weve never come across a patient like this, said John Wood, the head of the Molecular Nociception Group at University College London.","[Read more about how pain tolerance and anxiety may be connected.]","Scientists have been documenting case studies of individuals who experience little or no pain for nearly 100 years. But the genetic mutation that seems to be responsible for Ms. Camerons virtual painlessness had not been previously identified.","The study emerged amid major developments in the emotionally charged debate over how to responsibly treat pain. On Thursday, New York State filed one of the most sweeping legal cases yet against the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid OxyContin.","And it was yet another reminder that we need less addictive alternatives for chronic pain, said Dr. Stephen G. Waxman, a neurologist at Yale and the author of Chasing Men on Fire: The Story of the Search for a Pain Gene. Dr. Waxman was not involved in the recent paper but he also studies people who have rare mutations that alter their experience of pain.","Each of these mutations teach us something, and point to a particular gene as a potential target for new and more effective pain medications, he said.","","Earlier reporting on medical mysteries"," Congratulations, Its Twins. The Doctor Is Perplexed."," It Looked Like a Beer Belly. It Turned Out He Had a 77-Pound Tumor."," When the Illness Is a Mystery, Patients Turn to These Detectives","","The sequence of events that led scientists to investigate Ms. Camerons genes began about five years ago. She was living a happy, ordinary life on the banks of Loch Ness in Scotland with her husband, she said. After a hand operation, a doctor seemed perplexed that she was not experiencing any pain and did not want painkillers.","I guarantee I wont need anything, Ms. Cameron recalled telling Dr. Devjit Srivastava, a consultant in anesthesia and pain medicine at a National Health Service hospital in northern Scotland and one of the authors of the paper.","A few follow-up questions revealed that Ms. Cameron was unusual. At 65, shed needed to have her hip replaced. Because it had not caused her pain, she had not noticed anything was amiss until it was severely degenerated. Cuts, burns, fractures  these did not hurt either. In fact, it often took the smell of burning flesh or her husband identifying blood for her to notice something wrong. She also reported that eating Scotch bonnet chili peppers left only a pleasant glow.","Dr. Srivastava referred her to University College Londons Molecular Nociception Group, a team focused on genetic approaches to understanding the biology of pain and touch. They had some clues for her. In recent decades, scientists have identified dozens of other people who process pain in unusual ways. But when Dr. James Cox, a senior lecturer with that group and another author of the new paper, inspected her genetic profile, it did not resemble that of others known to live without pain.","Eventually he found what he was looking for on a gene the scientists call FAAH-OUT. All of us have this gene. But in Ms. Camerons, the patient has a deletion that removes the front of the gene, he said. Additional blood work confirmed this hypothesis, he said.","Ms. Cameron said she had been shocked by the interest in her case. Until her conversation with Dr. Srivastava, pain was not something she thought about. Perhaps it helped that even though she burned and cut herself quite often, her injuries rarely left scars  something else that scientists believe is connected to the mutation.","[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]","A number of articles have been written about parents of children with similar conditions. Many live in fear that without pain, their children wont learn how to avoid hurting themselves. Her parents never made it an issue, she said. She suspects this may be because she inherited the mutation from her father.","I cant remember him needing any painkillers, she said. I think thats why I didnt find it odd.","Unfortunately, because he died before the discovery, it will remain unknown whether he carried the mutation. Her mother does not share it. Neither does her daughter. Her son has the same microdeletion in FAAH-OUT, but does not have the other mutation that confers reduced FAAH function, Dr. Cox said.","In other words, her son shares some, but not all, of her pain insensitivity.","Scientists are also intrigued by Ms. Camerons extraordinarily low anxiety level. On an anxiety disorder questionnaire, she scored zero out of 21. She cannot recall ever having felt depressed or scared.","I am very happy, she said.","In retrospect, she sees how her genetic disposition may have aided her at work. After years as a primary-school teacher, she retrained to work with people with severe mental disabilities. Erratic, aggressive behavior never riled her, she said.","But though having this mutation may sound like a dream, there are downsides. One is that she is quite forgetful; prone to losing her keys and her train of thought midsentence. The other is that shes never felt the adrenaline rush that other people talk about, she said.","The researchers said they would now focus on trying to better understand how FAAH-OUT works so that they can design a gene therapy or other pain intervention around it. Turning a discovery of this sort into an actual pain or anxiety treatment requires many steps, many years and many millions of dollars. Its rare for a product to emerge.","But its not unprecedented, Dr. Waxman said. As a reminder of how an individual with an unusual genetic makeup can shape the future of medicine, he pointed to statin drugs.","They were developed largely on the basis and discovery of incredibly rare families where everyone was having heart attacks in their 20s, he said. Whether it will be Ms. Camerons mutation or another individuals mutation that directs the future of painkillers, its too early to say.","But Im reasonably confident that the lessons we are learning from the genes involved in pain will lead to the development of an entirely new class of pain medications, he said.","Related Coverage","How Pain Tolerance and Anxiety Seem to Be Connected","New York Sues Sackler Family Members and Drug Distributors","The Hazards of Growing Up Painlessly","Advertisement","Site Index","news","opinion","arts","living","more","Subscribe","Site Information Navigation"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Many people know what they want it to say  what they feel it simply must say  namely, that Donald Trump is a criminal who should be removed from office. Or that he is completely innocent of all wrongdoing.","But not everyone knows what it must say. Even though I believe Mr. Trump is morally unfit to be president of the United States, Im not rooting for Mr. Mueller to demonstrate that he is a criminal. Im also not rooting for Mr. Mueller to clear the president. Im not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work, charge whatever cases warrant charging and report on his work.","President Trumps constant attacks on the special counsel, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department over the past two years raised the prospect that he would interfere to stop the special counsels work. It is deeply concerning that the president of the United States would try to protect himself by torching the institutions of justice. But he hasnt used his authority to end Mr. Muellers work. (That would have been a crisis of a different order  shutting down the investigation, rather than just trying to undermine its credibility.) So we are in a position to wonder and hope about the reports content.","Wondering is fine. But hoping for a particular answer is not. The rule of law depends upon fair administration of justice, which is rooted in complete and unbiased investigation. We are best served when an investigation finds all relevant facts and illuminates the fullest possible view of the truth.","I have no idea whether the special counsel will conclude that Mr. Trump knowingly conspired with the Russians in connection with the 2016 election or that he obstructed justice with the required corrupt intent. I also dont care. I care only that the work be done, well and completely. If it is, justice will have prevailed and core American values will have been protected at a time when so much of our national leadership has abandoned its commitment to truth and the rule of law.","I am rooting for a demonstration to the world  and maybe most of all to our president and his enablers  that the United States has a justice system that works because there are people who believe in it and rise above personal interest and tribalism. That system may reach conclusions they like or it may not, but the apolitical administration of justice is the beating heart of this country. I hope we all get to see that.","The interests of justice will also be best served by maximum transparency about the special counsels work. I dont know all the considerations that will go into deciding precisely what to say about the completion of that work and when to say it. But because the Department of Justice is guided first and always by the public interest, it should provide details about finished investigations when the public needs to know them, as it traditionally has.","I do have one hope that I should confess. I hope that Mr. Trump is not impeached and removed from office before the end of his term. I dont mean that Congress shouldnt move ahead with the process of impeachment governed by our Constitution, if Congress thinks the provable facts are there. I just hope it doesnt. Because if Mr. Trump were removed from office by Congress, a significant portion of this country would see this as a coup, and it would drive those people farther from the common center of American life, more deeply fracturing our country.","Critics of Mr. Trump should hope for something much harder to distort, or to nurse as a grievance, than an impeachment. We need a resounding election result in 2020, where Americans of all stripes, divided as they may be about important policy issues  immigration, guns, abortion, climate change, regulation, taxes  take a moment from their busy lives to show that they are united by something even more important: the belief that the president of the United States cannot be a chronic liar who repeatedly attacks the rule of law. Then we can get back to policy disagreements.","I just hope we are up to it.","James Comey is a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the author of A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.","The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The rapper said that when his name is mentioned, it should be with the likes of Tupac, Biggie and Nas.","\"I'm the hardest young n***a. I'm the hardest rapper in the game, I promise.

By using our website you consent to all cookies in accordance with our updated Cookie Notice.","Chicago makes history electing Lori Lightfoot as first black woman mayor","These countries give the most aid - and are the most principled about it","MENAs growing young population is a huge opportunity  if we get it right","In Quito, about 70% of the deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases like hypertension and diabetes. Obesity is a primary risk factor, and here  like just about everywhere in the world  we suffer from rising rates of childhood obesity.","Almost 27% of school-age children are either overweight or obese in Ecuador, compared with 31% in the US. The same risk factors apply in both countries, and everywhere else around the world: more processed foods, high in calories from sugar and fat but low in nutrients; more sweetened beverages and sodas; less fruit and vegetables; and less exercise.","Children who are overweight or obese are more likely to become adults with the same weight problems. And being overweight or obese increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attacks, some forms of cancer, and other non-communicable diseases.","The trend is also worsening, with more than 672 million people who qualify as obese  thats more than one out of every eight adults in the world. Here in Ecuador, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) cost the federal government $4.3 billion annually.","In both Ecuador, and the US  and again, most everywhere else  poverty and a subsequent lack of affordable food plays a significant role in the obesity crisis. The most recent United Nations report on nutrition highlights how economic inequities feed these health disparities: The higher cost of nutritious foods, the stress of living with food insecurity and physiological adaptations to food restriction help explain why food insecure families may have a higher risk of overweight and obesity.","That is why, in Quito, were working to tackle this crisis in the one place where we know we can reach the children  in school. As part of Bloomberg Philanthropies Partnership for Healthy Cities, the Pilas con las Vitaminas pilot program is now providing healthy meals in school food kiosks in six districts, while a healthy eating curriculum is being taught in classrooms. At the same time, we are working in communities to help everyone understand the importance of healthier nutrition, so that the nutrition lessons taught and modeled in the classroom are brought home to families.","What does this look like from a students perspective? Out goes the American fast foods, the French fries, hamburgers, and pizza. Instead, the meals available to students will be more traditional and healthier fare  foods made from chochos (high-protein beans), quinoa, amaranth, green plantain and corn. Our schools will provide more fruit and vegetables and less fat, salt and sugar.","The kiosks selling the healthier foods have been rebranded with colorful images and a marketing plan that will adjust for the seasons and holidays. The students have been suspicious of these changes, but our educational community  teachers, school administrators and staff  have embraced this new direction and are working with families to make it successful.","Remarkably, the cost of the new programme has been minimal. The roll out and marketing of the new menu choices and the healthier options represented only about 20% of our school food budget for the first year, and we anticipate cost savings as the programme becomes better established.","We will assess how this pilot project works at the end of the school year, but we have already observed success elsewhere in the world. In the US, a chef from one of the worlds finest restaurants created and delivered a healthy menu for 3,300 students in New London, Connecticut, and is now increasing the scope of operations in a pilot program in New York Citys least wealthy borough, the Bronx.","In London, UK, there is a movement to bring more chefs into school cafeterias and avoid pre-packaged nuggets and chips. There is even a new law, effective in 2019, that will ban new fast-food restaurants from opening within quarter of a mile of any primary or secondary school.","One aspect that catches our eye is how healthy eating translates into healthy test scores. Researchers looking at schools in the state of California saw that while student scores increased when healthy meals were served, the score increases were up to 40% larger for students coming from less wealthy families  the ones most likely to need the school lunches in the first place.","But the hard data on school lunches and childhood obesity remains front and centre in our efforts. In Japan, serving healthy school lunches was found to lower obesity rates and even increase student height. Earlier research in Tokyo established the importance of these meals in keeping students from impoverished communities well fed and thriving.","Like all mayors around the world, I want to see my constituents healthy and thriving. But local governments cannot do all of the work on their own. We need to partner with regional and national governments in promoting healthy lifestyles, from reining in misleading advertisements to creating agricultural policies that help farmers produce more nutritious foods.","Through the school lunch initiative, we have now acquired a more complete picture of our childrens well-being. As we continue to develop new strategies that limit the risk factors of non-communicable diseases, our experience reminds us that everyone should have the means to grow up healthy and happy.","Written by","Mauricio Rodas Espinel, Mayor of Quito, Municipality of Quito","The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.","Featured:\n                Global Health\n                                        View all","Mosquito-borne diseases could spread to a billion more people as climate warms","5 ways the private sector can help towards universal healthcare in Africa","4 radical shifts required to achieve universal health coverage worldwide","One in five deaths worldwide linked to unhealthy diet","Most CEOs dont have a global health strategy.

Popocatepetl for a very long time. Could it be possible that we are now on the verge of the most destructive volcanic eruption in the modern history of North America? On Monday night at precisely 9:38 PM, a massive explosion at Mt. Popocatepetl sent a column of volcanic ash nearly a mile into the sky. A yellow alert warning has been issued by the authorities, and they are ordering everyone to stay at least 12 kilometers away from the crater. They are stressing that the threat has not passed, and as you will see below, an evacuation plan is in place in case an even larger eruption follows. And if a much larger eruption does follow, the devastation could be off the charts. Mexico City is only 43 miles away from Mt. Popocatepetl, and approximately 25 million people live within a 60 mile radius of the crater.","The explosion on Monday night was definitely a wake up call. According to media reports, it wasloud enough to shake doors and windows of houses in the city of Puebla","Mexicos Popocatepetl volcano erupted late on Monday,hurling incandescent rock about 1.5 miles down its slopesand sending ash into the night sky near the nations capital.","The explosion, one of the volcanos largest eruptions in years, was heard from nearby communities and wasloud enough to shake doors and windows of houses in the city of Puebla, according to local media.","Mt. Popocatepetl has been increasingly active in recent months, and authorities are concerned that all of this activity could be leading up to something really big.","In fact, it is being reported that they arecurrently preparing for the worst case scenarios","Local authorities are currently preparing for the worst case scenarios and havent ruled out more eruptions in the near future.","In preparations, they have drafted a special operational plan allowing for quick evacuation of locals in case of any future emergencies.","Popocatepetl exploded earlier this week but had remained calm over the past several days as it only emitted water vapour, gas and a small amount of ash.","So what would a worst case scenario for Mt. Popocatepetl look like?","Well, scientists tell us that the volcano is capable of producing acatastrophic Plinian eruption","Popocatpetl is considered the most threatening volcano in North America, in terms of explosive activity and population threat.Its current low- or moderate-scale eruptive behavior can switch relatively quickly toa large, catastrophic Plinian eruption, the largest and most violent of all the types of volcanic eruptions, according to the volcanologistsat the National History Museum.","If you have never heard of a Plinian eruption before, here isWikipedias definition","Plinian eruptionsorVesuvian eruptionsarevolcaniceruptionsmarked by their similarity to theeruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD, which destroyed the ancient Roman cities ofHerculaneumandPompeii. The eruption was described in a letter written byPliny the Younger, after the death of his unclePliny the Elder.","Plinian/Vesuvian eruptions are marked by columns ofvolcanic debrisandhot gasesejected high into thestratosphere, the second layer of Earths atmosphere. The key characteristics are ejection of large amount ofpumiceand very powerful continuous gas-driven eruptions. According to theVolcanic Explosivity Index, Plinian eruptions have a VEI of 4, 5 or 6, sub-Plinian 3 or 4, and ultra-Plinian 6, 7 or 8.","Short eruptions can end in less than a day, but longer events can take several days or even months. The longer eruptions begin with production of clouds of volcanic ash, sometimes withpyroclastic surges. The amount ofmagmaerupted can be so large that it depletes the magma chamber below, causing the top of the volcano to collapse, resulting in acaldera.","We are talking about a disaster that could potentially kill millions.","In the Aztec language, Popocatepetl literally means smoking mountain, but to most of the locals the volcano is simply known as Don Goyo. In ancient times, it produced giant tsunamis of super heated mud that completely buried entire Aztec cities. The following is an excerptfrom one of my previous articles","Historians tell us that Popocatepetl had a dramatic impact on the ancient Aztecs.Giant mud flows produced by massive eruptions covered entire Aztec cities. In fact, some of these mud flows were so large that they buriedentire pyramidsin super-heated mud.","But we havent witnessed anything like that in any of our lifetimes, so it is hard to even imagine devastation of that magnitude.","In addition to Mexico Citys mammoth population, there are millions of others that live in the surrounding region. Overall, there are about 25 million people that live in the immediate vicinity of Popocatepetl. Thankfully, we havent seen a major eruption of the volcano in modern times, but at some point that will change.","Considering what this volcano is capable of doing, I simply dont understand why there was so little coverage of this massive explosion on Monday by the mainstream media in the United States.","I guess they didnt have any room after allocating front page space tothe powerball jackpotandthe ongoing drama surrounding Wendy Williams.","We live at a time when our planetis becoming increasingly unstable, and many believe that the shaking is only going to get worse.","Mt. Popocatepetl had been dormant for a very long time before it started becoming active again in the 1990s.","Now it has apparently entered an extremely active phase, and we know that it is capable of producing a catastrophic Plinian eruption.","So lets keep a very close eye on Mt.

In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons, MPs voted by 344 to 286 against the deal as hundreds of protesters staged a noisy demonstration outside on the day when the UK was due to leave the European Union.   Some 34 Conservative rebels ignored a last-ditch plea from the Prime Minister to take \"the last opportunity to guarantee Brexit\" and consigned her deal to its third humiliating defeat.   The result of the crunch vote means that the UK has missed an EU deadline to secure an extension of the Brexit process and leave with a deal on May 22.   Mrs May now has until April 12 to go back to Brussels with new proposals and seek a longer extension to the negotiation process, or see the UK leave without a deal that day.   With a clear majority in the Commons against no-deal, and with MPs once more seizing control of the timetable on Monday, Mrs May said the UK would have to find \"an alternative way forward\".   This was \"almost certain\" to involve the UK having to stage elections to the European Parliament in May, she said.","Mrs May said that the outcome was \"a matter of profound regret\".   Despite the setback, Downing St said it was not an \"inevitability\" that the UK would have to participate in the European elections and made clear she would continue to fight for her deal.   After defeats of 230 and 149 in the previous two Commons votes, a No 10 source said they were \"at least going in the right direction\".   \"We continue to believe that the deal the PM has negotiated is the best outcome for the country and we will continue to seek a way forward,\" the source said.   European Council president Donald Tusk called an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels on April 10 to discuss the implications of the vote.   Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election unless the Prime Minister was willing to find an alternative deal.   And Mrs May - who had promised to step down as Prime Minister if her deal was approved - appeared to hint that this was a possibility, telling MPs: \"I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House.\"   She said: \"This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table.   \"And today it has rejected approving the Withdrawal Agreement alone and continuing a process on the future.   \"This Government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands.\"","Mr Corbyn told MPs: \"The House has been clear this deal now has to change, there has to be an alternative found.   \"And if the Prime Minister can't accept that then she must go - not at an indeterminate date in the future but now, so that we can decide the future of this country through a general election.\"   The fate of Mrs May's deal was sealed as 34 Conservative MPs went through the No lobby, while only five Labour MPs voted with the Prime Minister.   The number of Tory rebels was fewer than half the 75 who opposed the deal in the Meaningful Vote of March 12 but enough to overturn the result had they voted the other way.","Among rebels were hardline Brexiteers including Mr Baker, Sir Bill Cash, Priti Patel, Owen Paterson and Sir John Redwood, along with supporters of a softer deal like Dominic Grieve, Justine Greening and Sam Gyimah.   Labour MPs backing the deal were Kevin Barron, Rosie Cooper, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint and John Mann, along with the party's former MPs Frank Field and Ian Austin, now sitting as independents.   DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said Mrs May had missed \"numerous\" opportunities to remedy the \"deficiencies\" in proposed backstop arrangements for the Irish border, which made the deal unacceptable to his party.   \"Over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to play a central role to chart a route that respects the democratic desire to leave the European Union but that does so in a way that strengthens our United Kingdom,\" said Mr Dodds.","Follow us"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The cloud storage service offers new users 2GB for free, along with access across multiple devices; however how those devices are linked to an account is changing, and it could end up causing frustration.","Until now, Dropbox has allowed an unlimited number of devices to be linked with a single Dropbox account. Linking takes place whenever a user installs the Dropbox app, whether the mobile version such as for iOS and Android, or the desktop version for macOS and Windows. Files are automatically synchronized across linked devices.","As of this month, however, Dropbox is changing how linking works for free accounts. Dropbox Plus and Dropbox Premium users  who pay from $9.99 per month and get not only more storage but offline sync, priority support, and remote device wipe, among other features  will still be able to link an unlimited number of devices with their account. Dropbox Basic accounts, however, will be limited to just three devices.","The new limit, spotted by Liliputing, could make for a far more frustrating experience among Dropbox users. One of the most common applications for the cloud service is to keep a set of files consistent across multiple devices. With the three device limit, however, its entirely possible that users wont be able to achieve that any more, at least not without paying Dropbox for a subscription.","Its possible to unlink old devices to free up slots if youre on the Dropbox Basic plan. To do that, you first need to sign in to Dropbox in the browser, then go to Settings, then the Security tab, and finally scroll to the list of linked devices. Clicking the X next to a device will unlink it from the account, at which point it will cease automatically synchronizing.","After that, it should be possible to add a new linked device. Alternatively, when you install the app on a new device, youre given a list of older devices that you can remove from the three slots, taking up one of their places with the new installation.","There are a few saving graces to Dropboxs decision. For a start, if youre a Basic user who already had more than three devices linked prior to this change in policy, the company wont be forcing you to de-authorize some. Previously linked devices will remain linked, Dropbox says, but you wont be able to add any new ones.","If you just want to access your files from another place, meanwhile, accessing Dropbox through the browser interface doesnt count as linking. Of course, you dont then get automatic synchronization, but that may not be a concern if all you need is a file or two from a friend or colleagues computer.","[Updated to reflect how new installations can handle old devices linked to Dropbox Basic accounts]","Story Timeline","2019 Audi e-tron range revealed for US: What you need to know","Apple AirPods 2 Review: The Sound of Convenience","5G is a war the US is about to lose warns DoD","Borderlands 3 release date confirmed, PC version exclusive to Epic","2020 iPhone 5.42-inch could give iPhone SE fans hope","Netflix orders Q-Force adult animation about LGBTQ superspies","Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K gets Miracast display mirroring support","Doom Linear mod packs entire game into single demonic hallway","Google Maps rolling out Waze-like slowdown reports feature","Jeeps 2020 Gladiator Launch Edition sold out in a day","Apple AirPods 2 Review: The Sound of Convenience","Honor View 20 Review","Huawei MateBook X Pro (2019) Review","Simplehuman Rectangular Sensor Can Review: A $250 trash investment","Welcome to Apocalypseburg LEGO Review: Epic Ape!","Site Information","Policies","Social and Media"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Speaking to Paul Schwartz of the New York Post, the executive discussed how the trade ultimately developed, noting that the receivers distractions (along with a hefty offer from Cleveland) made a trade morepalatable.","Obviously theres a lot of stuff that factors in, but at the end of the day, in order for us to move Odell, the other team was going to have to knock it out of the park, Gettleman said. We were not actively shopping him.","The Browns apparently made an offer that grabbed the attention of the Giants, with New York receivingClevelands first-round pick (No. 17 overall), third-round pick (95th overall), and young safety Jabrill Peppers. While the Giants never intended to trade Beckham when they signed him to a lucrativefive-year, $95MM contract last August, the Browns offer was ultimately too good to refuse.","Some have questioned why we signed Odell [last August] and then traded him, Gettleman said. We didnt sign him to trade him but obviously things changed. Frankly, what changed is another team made an offer we couldnt refuse. As it turned out, the fact he was signed for five more years made him very attractive and allowed us to get legitimate value.","Gettleman did acknowledge that he made one phone call regarding Beckham. Following the Bills failed pursuit of former Steelers wideout Antonio Brown, the Giants contacted Buffalo about a trade. The general managed said he also hadnumerous conversations with 49ers general manager John Lynch. Based on Gettlemans assertions, we can only assume it was Lynch who contacted the Giants front office.","Photo courtesy of USA Today Sports Images.","12 comments on Giants GM: We Were Not Actively Shopping OBJ","Lynch is turning out to be a bum, signing no one but injured players, have they drafted well and still have no wrs to pair with jimmy g. D line also stinks a beavy of top rated dline going there to do nothing.","Buckner is a bust then huh?","That wasnt a Lynch pick. If anything it helps his point that Lynch hasnt got them anything better than the awful Trent Baalke.","Had he not drafted Kittle he would be considered a disaster. Hes looking more and more like Ball 2.0.","D Line will be much improved this season though. Add in (hopefully) Bosa or Allen to this group and it could be a top front in the league.","Whats wrong with signing high risk high reward players to low risk high reward contracts, there is an article before this one that explains how the niners are on the hook for a lot of guaranteed money this season and then next season the guarantees are less than 3 million a season to everyone they have signed so far, maybe lynch doesnt know what hes doing but someone in the niners organization does","Say what? Typical LA fan. Why dont you worry about losing another world series and stay off NFL blogs.","and by say not actively shopping OBJ, I mean I was only contacting ever team in the league maybe once or twice a day. Not like three or four times a day","I believe Gettlemen wasnt shopping him. He doesnt know what he is doing g day to day hour to hour minute by minute. Absolutely clueless","Gettleman was blown away by an offer that has since been panned by practically every analyst. If youre going to trade an elite talent like OBJ, then you absolutely should be shopping him. You shouldnt be just taking basically the first and only offer you received. Utterly clueless, both with this and his other moves.","Frankly, what changed is another team made an offer we couldnt refuse.","I dont believe Dorsey is Sicilian and the Colts or Broncos would be more likely to put a horse head in someones bed.","Look they just made a trade swapping players.  Im sure they had asked the question about OBJ, like what would it take.  And the Browns did some DD, figured on what they needed for next year vs what theyd get with the draft picks, could they replace Peppers etc and its a good package for the Giants.","Leave a Reply Cancel reply","Please login to leave a reply.

Like the location of the first debate -- Miami, Florida -- Detroit is the largest city in a critical swing state that supported President Trump in 2016.","\"Detroit embodies the values and character of the Democratic Party,\" said DNC Chair Tom Perez in a statement. \"It's a city of grit and determination, a city that has gotten knocked down only to get back up stronger. With its diversity, its storied history, and its proud ties to the labor movement, Detroit is the perfect place for our party's second debate.\"","The debate will be broadcast live on CNN. Given the large number of Democratic candidates, the debates will be held on back-to-back nights, with the lineups for each night to be chosen at random.","There will be 12 primary debates in total. The DNC made waves earlier in March for announcing itwould not partner with Fox Newsfor a debate.","In February, the DNC detailed thecriteria candidates must meetto be included in the first two debates. Each candidate must have at least 1 percent support in three separate polls from a list of reputable state and national polling outfits determined by the committee. Candidates must also meet two fundraising thresholds: donations from at least 65,000 individuals, and 200 unique donors from at least 20 states.","Candidates who meet both criteria will be included in the debate. If more than 20 candidates meet the threshold, the DNC said it will use \"a methodology that gives primacy to candidates meeting both thresholds, followed by the highest polling average, followed by the most unique donors\" to determine participants.","The format is meant to give \"all types of candidates the opportunity to reach the debate stage and [give] small-dollar donors a bigger voice in the primary than ever before,\" Perez said at the time.","The DNC came under fire during the 2016 primaries for initiallylimiting the number of debates, which many supporters of Sen.

Tesla is yet to release any lower-cost variants of the Model 3 in China, though Gigafactory 3s rapid progress suggests that the Asian country could welcome its first genuinely affordable, locally-produced Model 3 later this year.","Elon Musk noted during Gigafactory 3s groundbreaking ceremony that affordable variants of the Model 3 and Model Y will be produced in China as soon as the facility is ready for vehicle production.

Their most high-profile pursuit was that of Manny Machado. Prior to the Winter Meetings, GM Rick Hahn tried to make it clear to reporters that he couldnt guarantee by any stretch that were going to convert on these targets. Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel notwithstanding, the dust has settled on the offseason, and the White Sox failed to convert on any premium player they were targeting.","Looking at what the team actually did, this was a fairly typical recent White Sox offseason. Its just that fan expectations tend to balloon when front office brass is meeting with Bryce Harper and Manny Machado, we know the team can afford either player, and its about that time where a rebuilding process draws to a close. The club hung around in the Machado bidding til the bitter end, strangely acquiring Mannys brother-in-law Yonder Alonso and good friend Jon Jay presumably to help close the gap on an offer that fell far short. Heres White Sox executive vice president Kenny Williams attempting to defend the teams eight-year, $250MM final offer, as reported byDaryl Van Schouwen of the Chicago Sun-Times: People are lost on the fact that on a yearly basis, our offer was more than San Diegos. The average annual value was $31 [million] and change. So it was about years guaranteed. So there is an argument that could be made that our offer was the better of the two. It certainly had more upside for him. All he had to do was basically stay healthy.This is almost comical, as is Williams assertion that if the team had gone further financially, fans would have been much more disappointed in our inability to keep this next core together. The key piece of that core, Eloy Jimenez, remains a minor leaguer for the purpose of gaining control of his 2025 season. The teams next core literally hasnt reached the Majors yet, but giving Machado an extra two years would break it up?","Chicagos offer to Machado came in a full $50MM shy of the contract he received from the Padres. The Sox thought this star free agent was going to be swayed by a ridiculous $100MM in additional non-guaranteed money, or by the acquisition of his buddies? Going into free agency, there was never a reason to think $250MM would get the job done for Machado or Harper, so why even try? Hahns claim that the Sox made a very aggressive offer is patently untrue. With every large market team sitting out Machados market and the price coming in much lower than it could have been, the White Sox still never got close. After losing out on Machado, Hahn pledged, The money will be spent. It might not be spent this offseason, but it will be spent at some point. This isnt money sitting around waiting to just accumulate interest. Its money trying to be deployed to put us in best position to win some championships.","Perhaps Hahn said that so that Sox fans will dream about signing Anthony Rendon or Xander Bogaerts next winter, but the Machado progression hardly inspires confidence that White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf is willing to outspend the field for a premium free agent. When Reinsdorf last did that by signing Albert Belle  over 22 years ago  Bud Selig and the owners were stunned that the owner whos railed the loudest and longest about curbing player salaries has just broken the bank, wrote Jon Pessah in his 2015 book The Game. Theres little reason to think Reinsdorf will shatter precedent again.","Given the self-imposed $250MM limit on Machado, the White Sox knew they werent going to get close on Harper. The White Sox certainly explored other avenues, including upgrades at catcher. They made a multiyear offer (terms unknown) to Yasmani Grandal, according to Robert Murray of The Athletic. And the Sox were in the mix for J.T. Realmuto, according to Ken Rosenthal. The White Sox had moved on from last years tandem, Omar Narvaez and Kevan Smith, deciding someone new should pair with Welington Castillo in 2019. They went with non-tendered former Tigers catcher James McCann. Patrick Nolan of Sox Machine disparaged the choice, writing, The White Sox young pitchers have had the misfortune of throwing to tiny strike zones and guys who let the ball get away, and McCanns poor receiving and pitch-blocking will help continue that trend. Its particularly painful to see a pitchers dream backstop, Martin Maldonado, sign with a division rival for the same contract (although Maldonados asking price at the time McCann signed had not yet fallen to this level).","The White Sox made reasonable efforts to address their bullpen this winter, trading Narvaez for Colome in November and signing Herrera in January. Colome is under team control through the 2020 season, though his salary in that season will climb even higher than this years $7.325MM. Hes a solid reliever who stands a good chance of serving as the teams closer. They also signed Herrera to a two-year deal with a vesting option for a third season. Herrera had surgery in September to repair a torn Lisfranc ligament in his foot, but hes made his Cactus League debut, implying the procedure may not affect him during the 2019 season. Herreras got some other red flags, such as 2018s declining strikeout and ground-ball rates, but the 29-year-old still throws 97 miles per hour and has a chance to be a major asset to Chicago. Along with holdovers Nate Jones and Jace Fry, this could be a decent bullpen, especially compared to the cumulative work of last years unit. The White Sox reportedly showed interest in Adam Ottavino, Andrew Miller, and Joe Kelly before they signed elsewhere.","With highly-regarded pitching prospect Michael Kopech out for 2019 due to Tommy John surgery and James Shields gone to free agency (though technically still unsigned), the White Sox reportedly poked their head in on free agents Patrick Corbin, J.A. Happ, and Nathan Eovaldi, before ultimately trading for Ivan Nova in December. Nova, owed $8.5MM in 2019, is a pitch-to-contact, homer-prone veteran who projects for an ERA around 4.60. If youre looking for a veteran starter who could potentially be flipped for something interesting in July, Nova doesnt qualify. Nor does Ervin Santana, who signed a minor league deal but seems likely to eventually earn the teams fifth starter job.","Fundamentally this is a baseball deal, Hahn told reporters upon acquiring Alonso from the Indians in December, but that claim hardly stands up when looking at the types of contracts that comparable first-base-only sluggers received this offseason (MLBTR Free Agent Trackerlink). I again turn to Patrick Nolan of Sox Machine, who explains that adding Alonso at designated hitter will either eat into Daniel Palkas plate appearances or force everyone to watch Palka play the outfield more often, while it also helped out a division rival with $8 million in cash relief. Thats a little harsh, but in Nova and Alonso, the White Sox took on $17.5MM for a pair of players projected by Steamer and ZiPS to be worth about one WAR apiece in 2019. It feels like spending money just to spend money.","Jay, his friendship with Machado aside, is an acceptable veteran stopgap for a club that parted ways with longtime right fielder Avisail Garcia. Top prospect Eloy Jimenez will start the season at Triple-A after being optioned just hours ago  presumably to work on his defense or another semi-vague reason that will be resolved once he cannot accrue a full year of service time in 2019 (as is commonplace throughout the league with this caliber of prospect). Until Jimenez arrives, none of the White Sox outfielders look like part of their next contending team.","The truly baffling aspect of Chicagos offseason additions is that had they simply condensed the money offered to that patchwork collection of stopgaps, those resources couldve been utilized to up the offer to Machado  a transformative player whod move the needle considerably more not only in 2019 but in the long term. The near-$50MM they spent on this offseasons group is worth much more than $50MM in 2028-29 dollars. Perhaps the Padres wouldve been willing to further increase their proposal had the ChiSox presented a legitimately competitive offer, but the approach wouldve been much more understandable.","2019 Season Outlook","Fangraphs projects the White Sox as a 70-win team this year, virtually no different from the Tigers or Royals. Given the teams run at Machado, this may seem like an incredibly disappointing offseason, but go back to something Hahn said in September 2017: I think even under the most optimistic projections of our ability to contend, certainly 18 and 19 dont include the bulk of the time when we anticipate having a window open to us.","So, it seems the club was willing to sign Machado or Harper at a relative bargain price and maybe make a little noise in 19, but that duos free agency was always coming a year before the White Sox thought their team would be ready. The White Sox have just $12.5MM committed to two players for the 2020 roster, so theyll again enjoy major payroll flexibility in the offseason. Generally, you dont get a fourth year for an intentional rebuild, so its 2020 or bust for this group.","How would you grade the White Sox offseason?

The team is rebuilding with no real core in place. Thoughts that a premium free agent would put this team over the top are pipe dreams. They still need more time marinating at the bottom of the standings to one day soon field a contender. The frame work is in place on the farm to create a talented nucleus with Kopech and Eloy leading the way. Let the tanking begin!","Bryzzo2016","3 weeks ago","Let the tanking begin? Hahaha, coulda made that comment a decade ago. Their framework is not in place. Thats why many are down on them. The local media and whats left of their fanbase is beyond frustrating. Their inept and clueless front office has not proven they can even self scout, much less assess other teams talent. They claimed to be All In just a few years back and literally ended up with a worse record than teams ACTIVELY tanking. Boston fleeced them for the only star player they had in Sale. Moncada is already being compared to Buxton as a BUST. Giolito, Fulmer, Rodon, Lopez BUST, BUST, BUST, BUST. You mentioned Kopech?!? Haha, yeah, his arm fell off, so he wont even pick up a baseball til 2020. So what exactly is this framework? In spite of drafting high for several years now, nothing even remotely exciting.","Many have tried what the Cubs/Astros achieved, VERY FEW actually succeeded. Its pathetic that they signed all of Machados bum friends/relatives because they were so thirsty to get an actual stud player. The last time they signed a stud MLB free agent in his prime, it was Albert (or Joey) Belle and that dude was literally crazy. It was also over 25 years ago. If the fans and the media know this front office is a joke, obviously the players and their reps are aware. Its not like Manny turned them down for a contender.","Exactly ZERO reason to believe that this front office is just gonna wake up and figure it out all of a sudden. Couple that with a notoriously cheap owner, I dont see the White Sox being even remotely relevant any time soon.","Its sad really, Reinsdorf is not good for Chicago. Hes turned the Bulls and the Sox into jokes because of his cheapness and irrational loyalty to clown front office guys. Not trolling, not hating, just calling it like it is. I sincerely feel bad for my friends that are White Sox fans. Theyre not homers, they are livid with JR and this FO. It would only help Chicago if the Bulls and Sox were relevant. Sadly, I dont know when that could realistically happen.","CalcetinesBlancos","3 weeks ago","Lol Cubs fansmaybe stick to Schaumburg/Naperville (Omaha maybe? Lol) politics; this is a baseball forum.","LADreamin","3 weeks ago","Jesus man, breathe. They have a top 5 farm, so its not like help isnt on the way. They also have a high draft position from losing in 2018. I agree with you on some points, theyve had unfortunate luck with upper tier prospects, but prospects are unproven commodities and it happens. Every org has picked and invested in busted prospects. I mentioned Eloy and Kopech because I see them as the real deal. The White Sox started their rebuild after they traded Sale, so if youre measuring them on the Astros/Cubs 5 year tank plan, they still have a couple more years left, give them a break. Your vitriol is clearly showing.","Bryzzo2016","3 weeks ago","Im not a Sox fan, hahaha, Im breathing just fine. Honestly, my disdain is more for Reinsdorf than the Sox.

That pretty much guarantees theyll never get any elite talent.","tharrie0820","3 weeks ago","What do you consider a star?

Well, you can always watch reruns of Eight Men Out.","ChiSoxCity","3 weeks ago","Well, I posted a few comments earlier.  The admin chose not to post it for some reason.  They obviously have no problem with me calling the White Sox a third rate organization, owned by a penny-pincher and run by sycophantic yes-men.  Im thinking they didnt like me calling out the inevitable derisive cubs contingent.  The northside organization has been the same train wreck as the southsiders.  The cubs fanbase is not savvy enough to know or care.  But I digress.  The White Sox currently bring in roughly $240M in annual revenues the last I checked.  This is slightly below average for a MLB team, but its still plenty enough to get ONE ELITE PLAYER SIGNED.  JUST ONE.  Until the team is sold, or the current regime stops trying to catch lightning with a bottle and actually, you know, puts together a big league roster worth watching for once, the few people who care anymore have no good reason to attend any MLB games, let alone a White Sox game.","Bryzzo2016","3 weeks ago","ChiSox, I get that selective reasoning is probably the only way you can stomach whats happening (or not happening) on the south side, but this is a stretch even for you. Theo&Co did EXACTLY what he said hed do, actually a year earlier. More importantly, he assembled a sustainable contender. When was the last time the Sox made playoffs 4 straight years and counting? How about 3 straight NLCS? Theos 1st rounders and acquired prospects all graduated and won a ring. Theyre still together with most of them not even at their peak playing ages yet. They signed their free agent targets which successfully completed the CHAMPIONSHIP puzzle again that is still intact. Blah, blah, blah youve heard it before.","Sooooo, what about Cubs is a train wreck? As much as youd love it to be the case, you cant compare anything about the Sox to the Cubs. Stop yourself. At least try to hold on to some dignity.","Hahaha, as far as Cubs fans showing up to give trolls like YOU your medicine well, thats the tax for inexplicably trolling EVERY SINGLE Cubs post. Aside from the obvious irony, why would a White Sox fan troll ANY TEAM in baseball. Are you serious? Many are comparing your inadequacies as an organization to the Fn Marlins.","Ricketts went after a proven guy in Theo. Then he opened up the checkbook and Theo knew exactly what was needed. A COMPLETE organizational rebuild, tear down. Proven scouts, proven managers and coaches to develop the prospects. Who did the Sox hire? Scotty Fn Pods?!?!? Im sorry what about his track record even suggests he is qualified to be on the front line of development and scouting. He was cheap, which is EXACTLY why hes Reinsdorfs kinda guy. Its no coincidence that the HIGH 1st rd picks continue to miss. Why all these prospects were underwhelming to say the least when they graduated to the show. ALL OF THEM.","I get that your bitter, I can only imagine watching the clown college on the south side, but its not Cub fans you should be mad at. If you dont like being trolled. THEN STOP TROLLING. Especially when your team is the most irrelevant joke in pro sports. Its just a bad look.","ChiSoxCity","3 weeks ago","Im glad youre happy with four years of playoff appearances.  A short term memory is a prerequisite of any cubs fan, especially now.  I neednt remind you of the 100+ years of utter futility that is cubs baseball then.  Merely a distant memory of a bygone age.  Surely, that $200M roster makes the cubs a front runner on the senior circuit.  No?  Theyll have to fight for a playoff spot, you say?   Funny what a couple of bad contracts can do.  Better keep your eye on the ball, cubs fans.","Bryzzo2016","3 weeks ago","Hahaha, so when did the Sox go to the playoffs 4 years in a row again? Oh and this isnt history, this matters because this is the same team that won. The same core. This owner, front office, team has exactly ZERO to do with what happen over the last century good or bad. I personally havent gone 100 years with or without seeing anything. Just like the current Sox team has ZERO to do with 1917 or even 2005 for that matter. It doesnt matter how you desperately try to spin it. How far do you wanna go back? How many times have the Sox made the playoffs in the last 30 years? Division titles? Again, it doesnt matter how you slice it, it doesnt look good for the south side. Its like winning ugly only without the winning part.","ChiSoxCity","3 weeks ago","Its a near impossible task to talk baseball with a cubs fan, due to the myopic viewpoint and delusion.  But take a look at your ballclub, cuz the cubs are not half as good as they were in 2016.  You wanna talk about busts?  Schwarber, Happ, Contreras, Almora are replacement level.  I would call Heyward a bust, but hes more of a flop since hes never established much of a ceiling offensively.  Bryant may still be an elite player, but he wont be a cub much longer so its kind of moot.  Theyre an average defensive team with Baez at SS.  He leaves a sizable hole at 2nd.  This could have been avoided had Epstein not traded Torres for a 2.5 month rental of a relief pitcher, but I digress.  I wont even bother mentioning their rapidly declining rotation.  The balls will fly, and the cubs will struggle to score enough runs to win most days.  It wont be pretty.  On the flipside of this is the cubs have a lot of money coming off the books the next few years.  Blowing it all up should move things along faster though.  Hope youre ready for a rebuild, and more disappointment in the free agent market.  Either way, the cubs are no longer a playoff team.  The Brewers and Cards are the class of the NL Central.","tim2686","3 weeks ago","The Sox bit hard on the Machado sweepstakes and came out losers; it happens. As a lifelong Sox fan I am not discouraged though, because the offer was there. The problem is that unproven talent is a crap shoot and prospects fail more often then not. I am glad they are staying the course, and would love them to spend some money on some higher profiled free agents, but it will not be this off-season. Jerry knows that and so does Hahn. Give Hahn a chance to see this through and keep Kenny out of the decision making process.

He took the contract with less AAV and less potential but more guaranteed money. Move on.","And anyone that thinks they screwed up by not signing other free agents instead is clueless. It was Machado, Harper, or nothing this offseason, and that is ABSOLUTELY the way it shouldve been.

We really wont have a playoffs with LeBron James.","The Los Angeles Lakers playoff chances arent mathematically zero, but theyre grim. As of March 5, LA trails the No. 8 seed San Antonio Spurs by 5.5 games with just 18 left to play. Theres less than six weeks for LeBron James and his teammates to figure out their defensive flaws and get a crack at postseason play.","Thats both statistically and realistically improbable. ESPNs Basketball Power Index gives the Lakers less than a one percent chance of playing postseason ball, which is 1.2 percent lower than the odds it gives the New Orleans Pelicans.","Late February and March have done no favors for the Lakers. LA has chucked away four of its last seven games to lottery teams, including the Hawks, Grizzlies, Anthony Davis-less Pelicans, and league-worst Suns. Now, after a loss to the crosstown rival Clippers, they are basically done.","Lets review where we stand.","The bottom of the Western Conference looks like this","The loss to the Clippers was the final nail in the coffin","Beating the Clippers wouldve obviously put the Lakers one full game closer to striking distance. But a win was also essential in the event of a tiebreaker. NBA playoff tie-breakers are broken first by head-to-head record, and second, by record against the teams own division.","But with a 113-105 loss, the Lakers will lose the season tiebreaker with the Clippers by way of either head-to-head matchup or division record. L.A. can only tie the season series at two, and have no chance of matching L.A.s 11-3 division record.","In other words: their deficit is really more like 6.5 games when you account for tiebreakers.","How else can the Lakers sneak into the playoffs?","Technically its possible, but only technically. Its too far off to get into the weeds, but LA will need to catch up to the Kings and Spurs should the Clippers pull ahead.","The Kings have a relatively easy finish to their schedule. With 19 games left, theyll play the Knicks, Mavericks twice, Wizards, Bulls, Suns, Pelicans, and Cavaliers. Thats eight games against teams unlikely to make the postseason. Theyll also play the Lakers once, with the season tiebreaker on the line.","The Spurs schedule is a bit tougher, and the team has admitted this wont be a title-contending year already by buying out Pau Gasols contract and letting him walk to the Milwaukee Bucks. They have easy games against the Hawks, Knicks, Mavericks twice, Cavs twice, and Wizards, but also play the Warriors, Rockets, Celtics, and Bucks.","San Antonio, however, has already won the head-to-head tiebreaker against the Lakers, so its lead is really an extra game more than it appears.","The Lakers remaining schedule looks like this","Those 18 games include just four against teams unlikely to factor in the playoff chase, and just three if you put the Wizards in the East mix. Against that schedule, they must make up six games, plus a tiebreaker over their top two contenders.","Its technically possible, but in reality, the chase is over.","Next Up In\n    \n        NBA","Most Read","Loading comments..."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Scaling that momentum.","Pete Buttigieg is having a moment.","After appearing at an hour-long CNN Town Hall in Austin, Texas last week, Buttigieg is on the rise. Over the weekend, he received donations from 65,000 people, which automatically qualified him to appear at the Democratic National Committees debate this June. Thats a pretty major milestone for an out gay mayor of a smaller Midwest city, who a whole lot of Democrats probably couldnt name at the beginning of the year.","The South Bend, Indiana mayor made a strong showing during the town hall, not only prompting a $600,000 surge of donations, but perhaps more importantly, Democrats and left-leaning independents wanting to know more about him. According to Google Trends, searches for his name have spiked in the last week.","Sure, Buttigieg, 37, would not be the first openly gay man to run for president (that was Fred Karger, running for the Republicans in 2012). And he has a great deal of name recognition to contend with among the pack of other candidates also vying for the Democratic ticket: Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and potentially Vice President Joe Biden, to name a few, all of whom have been figures on the national stage for years.","Currently 62 percent of most likely Democratic primary voters say theyve never heard of Buttigieg, according to a Morning Consult poll. Hes also polling at just one percent, tying for eight place with Montana Gov. Steve Bullock. Sure, its low, but Buttigieg was polling at zero percent at the end of February.","The same poll shows Buttigiegs favorability at 13 percent and a relatively low unfavorability rating at 7 percent, while another 18 percent say theyve heard of him but have no opinion.","With more eyes on Buttigieg, hes been seizing the moment; many of the points made to CNN and elsewhere are things hes been saying for some time, particularly, I have more years of government experience under my belt than the president. I also have more years of executive government experience than the vice president, and more military experience than anybody to walk into that office on day one since George H. W. Bush.","But notably, anecdotes about who he is as a person are trickling out. There was that time, according to Time reporter Anand Giridharadas, that Buttigieg started speaking Norwegian to a journalist at the drop of a hat, explaining that he learned the language to read the books of an author whose work was only available in Norwegian. His remarks to the Muslim people in his community after the deadly shooting in New Zealand were more articulate than President Trumps reaction to the extremists actions. And of course, there are Buttigieg memes.","pic.twitter.com/MtOhRn3ccX"," Eric Williams (@Eric_Williams_1) March 18, 2019","Democrats shouldnt discount the unprecedented excitement for an out, gay candidate being taken seriously. He may be polling at one percent now, but there was a time not too long ago that even having an openly gay man running for president would be laughable at best, and at worst, opening him up for ignorant treatment or threats of violence.","All of this is to say, Buttigieg is riding a wave. Will he ride it all the way to the White House? With a crowded field and low name recognition, his chances arent exactly high. Still, Democrats couldnt pick a more stark opponent for the Vice Presidential debates in fall 2020: Buttigieg versus Pence?

However, team sources Sunday were quick to leak to several reporters that Rosenthal's report is a bit overstated and that the team is simply doing standard due diligence.","I have no doubt that Mets GM Brodie Van Wagenen is always in touch with other teams and agents, keeping an open mind to any way his team can improve. So, the above report and response shouldn't be surprising because, 1) the Mets have available money in their 2019 budget, 2) they remain $30-40 million under the luxury tax threshold, and 3) both players would significantly improve Van Wagenen's roster.","The thing is, if given the green light and forced to choose, should Van Wagenen go Keuchel or Kimbrel?","To date, and since the end of last season, every team in the NL East (including the Marlins) has reportedly shown at least some level of interest in Kimbrel, though all five teams were said to only be willing to give a short-term deal. The Rays, Padres, Brewers and multiple other teams have reportedly shown interest in him as well.","Kimbrel, 30, had been seeking a nine-figure, six-year contract, which he is obviously not going to get at this point. This is why multiple insiders expect him to take a short-term deal allowing him to opt out after this season when he'll have very little competition on the open market.","In 62.1 innings during 2018, he had a 2.74 ERA (3.13 FIP), 0.99 WHIP and 96 strikeouts, though he walked eight batters and allowed seven runs in 10.2 innings during the postseason.","The idea of Kimbrel joining Justin Wilson, Seth Lugo, Robert Gsellman, Jeurys FamiliaandEdwin Diaz is worth considering because they would be - without question - the best bullpen in the National League. It would also mean Kimbrel NOT going to the Braves, Phillies or Nationals.","The thing is, even if the Mets were to outbid the competition with a lucrative short-term deal, I bet Kimbrel would take slightly less to join a team that would let him accumulate more saves and pitch in more high-leverage innings than he would get with the Mets - given the presence of Familia and Diaz. If Kimbrel's goal is to take one year and hit the free-agent market again next season, pitching for the Mets is not very smart.","Regardless, I'd prefer Van Wagenen make a push for Keuchel, who would cost New York a draft pick because he rejected Houston's $17.9 million qualifying offer after the 2018 season.","Kimbrel, a seven-time All-Star who won a World Series with the Red Sox, would be the better move on paper, but even the best relievers are so hit or miss that I'd rather see Brodie's remaining budget go to reinforcing the rotation, which is the backbone of his roster.","Keuchel, 31, won the AL Cy Young Award in 2015 after going 20-8 with a 2.48 ERA in 33 starts. In 204.2 innings and an American League-best 34 starts in 2018, he was 12-11 with a 3.74 ERA (3.69 FIP) and a 1.31 WHIP.","The way it stands, Corey Oswalt is expected to be Van Wagenen's first choice to be called up in the event Callaway is in need of a sixth starting pitcher. After Oswalt, the Mets would be forced to choose from Hector Santiago, Chris Flexen and others or weaken the bullpen to use Seth Lugo or Robert Gsellman.","On the other hand, Keuchel would give the Mets another left-handed pitcher and likely push Jason Vargas to a long-man, spot starter role, thus bumping Oswalt down in line. Callaway could also consider shifting to a six-man or one-on, one-off style rotation through most of the season, which is something he mentioned doing last year.","Frankly, if Keuchel is smart, he'd wait to see how Vargas does in his season debut Tuesday against the Marlins. Vargas had a terrific end to his 2018 and continued to look strong during Spring Training. If he pitches well to begin 2019, Van Wagenen and Callaway may be more inclined to trust he will continue what he started late last summer. If Vargas gets rocked, though, who knows, maybe Van Wagenen will give Keuchel's agent, Scott Boras, a call to do more than just 'check in.'","The Phillies, Nationals, Brewers and Padres had all been linked to Keuchel at some point during the offseason. However, from what I've heard, while the Phillies remain interested in giving him a short-term deal, the Nationals are unlikely to sign him because he'd essentially cost them $50 million in 2019 due to the luxury tax. And, while the Braves certainly need him, they too are an unlikely destination because signing him will cost a second-round draft pick, which they can't afford to do.","In the end, I expect Keuchel to eventually return to the Astros. My hunch is these recent rumors about the Mets and other teams are a last-ditch effort by his agent to squeak as much out of Houston as possible before going home instead of taking a similar deal from the Phillies.","Matthew Cerrone (Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Contact)  is lead writer of MetsBlog.com, which he created in 2003.

It is, after all, enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution. But like any dogma, there is utility in occasionally challenging the assumptions that undergird it.","Which brings me to a paper I recently read in the Sydney Law Review, titled The Case Against Free Speech. The author is Brian Leiter, a political philosopher at the University of Chicago. Leiter argues that we shouldnt think of free speech as an inherently good thing and that there are negative consequences for pretending that it is.","The sort of speech hes talking about is public, the kind of stuff we hear on television or read in newspapers. Hes not suggesting we should even think about regulating private or interpersonal speech. And in fact, he doesnt think we can even regulate public speech, mostly because we just dont have a reliable way to do it.","But he does raise some interesting objections against whats often called the autonomy defense of free speech, which holds that people are only free to the extent that theyre allowed to say what they want, read what they want, and determine for themselves what is true and what is false.","According to Leiter, this is a bogus argument because people are not actually free in the way we suppose. Were all conditioned by our environment, and what we want and think are really just products of social, economic, and psychological forces beyond our control. If hes right, then the autonomy defenses of free speech are just wrong, and probably dangerous.","I spoke to Leiter about what he thinks we get wrong about free speech, and why most of the arguments people make in defense of it fall apart when you examine them closely. A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.","Sean Illing","Let me start by summing up your argument as simply as I can, and then we can go from there. I take you to be saying that most of our public speech, the kind of speech we consider morally and politically serious, is not only useless but actually hinders our collective effort to get at the truth, and therefore we shouldnt permit its expression without considering the social costs.","Brian Leiter","Thats really close, but I think its not quite right in one important respect. Because at the end, I actually argue for a pretty strong libertarian approach to free speech, but not on the grounds that the speech necessarily has value. A lot of it has no value, as you correctly said in your summary.","But basically I dont think we can be confident that the regulation of speech, or the regulators of speech, would make the right choices in discerning what is good and bad speech, or what is helpful or unhelpful speech. But this says more about the pathologies of the American system than it does about the value of freedom of speech.","Sean Illing","Well come back to the regulator problem, because I think it ultimately undercuts any effort we could ever make to control speech. Maybe itll help if you first explain why you want to take a sledgehammer to this assumption that free speech is an inherently good thing for society.","Brian Leiter","My paper is about running through all the arguments people make in defense of this assumption and showing why they dont hold up. Ill start with the simplest one, which is this idea that a free marketplace of ideas is likely to help promote discovery of the truth. This is probably the most famous defense of free speech associated with the British philosopher John Stuart Mill.","But what people often dont stop and notice is that even Mill thought certain background conditions had to be established for it to really be true that a marketplace of ideas would lead to the discovery of the truth. Mill said, People have to be educated, and they have to be mature. Those are pretty thin conditions, and you might worry that a lot more is required for a real marketplace of ideas to be conducive to the truth.","As I point out, we have an important institution in American society that aims to discover the truth, namely the court system. And the striking thing about the court system is that it completely rejects the marketplace of ideas view. It says, Its crazy to think well discover the truth by just permitting people to express any view they want, make any claim they want. In the court system, we impose massive restrictions on speech to facilitate the discovery of truth.","Sean Illing","Okay, Im glad you brought up your court analogy. Heres my problem: A courtroom and a political community are wildly different contexts, which even you acknowledge in the article. To take just one difference: A courts job is to establish the facts so that jurists can decide accordingly. But politics is about values as much as facts. Is there any way for a community to decide how to live and whats worth pursuing without allowing the free exchange of ideas?","Brian Leiter","Fair question. I would disagree a bit with the assumption that politics is mainly about values rather than facts. An awful lot of politics is about facts and their relationship to the values that can be realized in concrete policies.","So take one of the examples I use: the Bush administrations efforts to justify the illegal war of aggression against Iraq in 2003. That turned heavily on the misrepresentation of the facts. It turned heavily on Fox News, in particular, indoctrinating a large part of the population into thinking there was some connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda when there was none.","And then take something like climate change, where theres a constant disagreement about the facts with so-called skeptics who insist, in the public sphere, that the science doesnt really establish this. These are fact disputes, not value disputes.","I certainly agree with you that there are value disputes, but the establishment of facts is hugely important.","Sean Illing","Just to be clear, Im not saying facts dont matter. Im saying politics is about deciding what we ought to do in light of what is. And in order to have that kind of conversation, we need the free exchange of ideas.","Brian Leiter","Again, Id resist that a little bit. I think most of our disputes are about factual questions. I mean, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren arent saying, In order to promote the values of equality and well-being, we need higher taxes on the rich. And the other side isnt saying, Were not interested in equality or freedom. They say, We dont think thats the way to realize those values.","Sean Illing","I disagree about that, but I dont want tumble down a rabbit hole here, so lets stay on topic. Is there any way to maintain a free society without simply accepting that most opinions on serious topics are bad and ill informed, and yet thats the price we pay for allowing citizens to express their political identity?","Brian Leiter","There is clearly a lot of value to people in letting them express their political identity, their moral views, and so on. Its important to peoples well-being to be able to speak their mind. I dont want to discount the value of that. I just think thats one value that should go into a broader calculation that takes into account all the harms that are related to the expression of certain kinds of views.","Sean Illing","Do you think people are free in any meaningful sense if what theyre allowed to hear, or see, or read, is controlled or constrained in any way?","Brian Leiter","It depends on what kind of control and regulation is involved. So Ill give you another analogy. I control what the students in my class read and discuss. I actually think this enhances their freedom and their autonomy by bringing to their attention substantive materials, helping them frame thinking about these particular issues, and so on. So regulation isnt necessarily incompatible with free thinking.","But that brings us back to the question I touched on at the very beginning. The best argument for broad freedom of expression is skepticism about whether those who would regulate expression would do so in a way that was productive and constructive, rather than simply making things worse.","Sean Illing","Although you keep expressing skepticism, you still seem to think wed be better off with gatekeepers  some institution or body of institutions that decides what should or shouldnt be expressed in the public sphere.","Brian Leiter","That would seem to be the conclusion following from the arguments in the first part of the paper. But my conclusion is that even if there isnt enough positive value to speech to justify its unfettered expression, there are certainly reasons to be worried about whether capitalist democracies will regulate speech in ways that arent simply pernicious.","But this has more to do with the pathologies of our political system than it does to do with the intrinsic value of speech. Thats one of the main points Im pressing on in this article.","Sean Illing","As I read your paper, I kept thinking about the media critic Walter Lippmann (whom I wrote about for Vox), who struggled with these same questions. He didnt think most people could be trusted to decide intelligently what ought to be done, so he wanted technocrats and experts to act as mediators of sorts. But the problem is always, who are the arbiters of worthy speech in this imagined order? And how will we stop them from abusing their power?","Brian Leiter","Under the current circumstances, I think thats exactly right. But Ill also quote the German philosopher Herbert Marcuse, who, when asked, Who will make these decisions, said, Who makes them now? And thats worth bearing in mind.","These decisions are, in fact, being made now. They just arent being made by bureaucrats. Theyre being made by Rupert Murdoch, by editors behind the scenes, by producers on TV programs, who themselves are responsive to all kinds of interested parties.","Sean Illing","Whats the alternative? We either live in a free society, or we dont. There does not seem to be much room for compromise here. I mean, theres no marketplace of ideas that isnt saturated with bad ideas, right?","Brian Leiter","I guess its a matter of degree. Again, I think the big problem now has to do with the pathologies of our political and economic system. Maybe what we need is for the political and economic system to change if were ever going to adopt a more sensible approach to the regulation of expression.","I also think most people fail to understand whats meant by free society. No one thinks we dont live in a free society because there are restrictions on public masturbation or public sex, right? There are always limits. We countenance all kinds of restrictions on freedom. Its always about trade-offs, and what were ultimately willing to live with.","Sean Illing","Well, Id say free speech is crucial to individual liberty in a way that, say, public masturbation isnt, but thats another argument. Its still not clear to me what youd have us do? What is the solution here?","Brian Leiter","Its important to recognize that most of what any of us believe about the world depends on intermediaries, people who guide us as to what we ought to believe because its true. I believe in evolution by natural selection, but not because I did all the experiments in the lab.","The big crisis of the internet era is that it has eliminated a lot of the traditional intermediaries, such as the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or PBS or the BBC and so on. Those old intermediaries werent perfect, but they were better than what we have now. So I think we need better intermediaries that help people to sort out the world.","But again, I dont anticipate a law being passed that shuts down Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh  were stuck with them. Which means were stuck with a public sphere filled with nonsense. So the short answer is that were screwed.","Sean Illing","Look, the ideal political system is one in which everyone is wise and discerning and cares very deeply about the truth. But such a system is not possible, has never been possible, and so we must live in the least imperfect and most just society possible. Has liberal democracy not proven to be just that?","Brian Leiter","Im not sure its that simple. Liberal democratic societies have certain values, and theyre mostly good. But the problem is having a capitalist economic system that pollutes the public domain and presents all sorts of obstacles to the intelligent expression and regulation of speech.","Under capitalism, at least the sort of capitalism we have now, the ruling class completely distorts our political process and the laws that get enacted. Until we do something about that, were not going to be in any position to hope that regulation of speech, let alone other aspects of law, will actually be conducive to human well-being.","Sean Illing","This is ultimately why I dont know what to do with your paper. I agree with your general diagnosis here, and yet we end up in a dead end.","Brian Leiter","Well, if I may reference one of my favorite philosophers, whom I know you like as well, Nietzsche said, Sometimes the truth is terrible. And I think theres value in recognizing the truth of our situation, even if its terrible.","We have massive amounts of worthless, dangerous speech in the public sphere right now, and at the same time I cant see any legal remedy that isnt likely to be used for even more pernicious ends. But the situation were currently in is quite dire, and the fact that we have a monster child as our president is proof of that fact.","Sean Illing","Given everything youve said, given the paucity of realistic solutions, whats the point of an article like this? Why make the case against free speech if there arent any viable means of improving speech?","Brian Leiter","The fact that there arent solutions now isnt a reason not to identify a problem. And of course, one point of the article is to challenge what I think is a slightly unthinking popular consensus. Free speech isnt an inherently good thing; it can be good or it can be bad, and normally we think of the law as something that can step in when things can be both good or bad, like operating a motor vehicle, for example, which is why we have rules about it.","But in the case of speech, we have good reason to be worried about whether well make the right rules. And therefore, the real question that we need to talk about isnt about assuming the intrinsic value of speech. Its about why we have a political and economic order that makes it impossible for us to regulate all the bad things about speech in a reliable way.","Next Up In\n    \n        Politics & Policy","Most Read","Vox Sentences","The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.","The Latest","Why Crazy Ex-Girlfriends series finale was so, so satisfying","Vox Sentences: A Saudi crackdown on womens rights","America is finally being exposed to the devastating reality of prison violence","Mark Halperin says his conduct has changed.

In addition, please read our Privacy Policy, which has also been updated and became effective May 23rd, 2018.","By choosing I Accept, you consent to our use of cookies and other tracking technologies.","The small difference that separates Japan from the West","The standout feature of the PS4s latest firmware update was Remote Play for iOS devices, but buried within the changelog was another seemingly minor addition: as of version 6.50 of the PS4 consoles firmware, you can remap the consoles enter button from the O to the X on Japanese consoles.","If youre a PS4 owner living outside of Japan, then youve probably never considered which button is the default confirm button on the console. In the West, we use the X button to confirm, and the O button handles exit and cancellation duties. But Japan has the opposite convention, creating a minor yet surprisingly annoying inconvenience for any non-Japanese owners of Japanese PS4s.","Version 6.50 of the consoles firmware update finally fixes this annoyance, allowing owners of Japanese PS4s to manually set how they want the two buttons to work within the systems menus. But the more interesting part of this story is why Japan and the rest of the world ended up settling on opposite control schemes for one of the most basic pieces of a consoles functionality in the first place.","I first encountered this phenomenon when I tried to play Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on the PS2. The game was the second one I ever owned for my PS2, which was my first console. I loaded the console up, popped the disc into the drive, pressed the Start button to move from the title screen to the main menu, and then tried to start a new game.","To my intense surprise, the game instantly kicked me back to the title screen. I blinked, confused at what had happened, and tried to do the same thing again. I got kicked out once more. And again. And again. Eventually  and I promise Im not making this up  I actually went back to the shop where I bought the game and exchanged it for a new copy. I literally thought my disc was defective.","Of course, all that had happened was that I was pressing the button we commonly think of in the West as being the confirm button (X) in a Japanese game that used the opposite (O). I was being kicked back out to the games title screen because I was continuously pressing the cancel button.","Its not just the Metal Gear Solid series that used the Japanese control scheme in their Western releases. Numerous Japanese games over the years have used O instead of X for their confirm button, including entries in the Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Zone of the Enders series. However, over the years, many have since switched to using X in their Western releases (sometimes controversially, as with Metal Gear Solids fourth entry).","Version 6.50 of the PS4s software doesnt fix this problem entirely. Many games have their controls hard-coded in, so whether you use X or O to confirm will come down to the region your games were produced in rather than your console.","What the new software does do, however, is let you change which button is used to select in the consoles system menus, meaning that if youre playing a Western game on a Japanese PS4, you wont have to switch between two different control schemes.","Until all developers start using the same control scheme for all PlayStation games, the issue isnt going to go away. But whats less clear is how exactly this difference came about in the first place. Theres very little conclusive evidence out there, but there are a few different theories.","The first is that theyre derived from the differences that cropped up between Sega and Nintendos consoles back in the 1980s and 90s. Nintendos first console, the NES, had its confirm button on the right (A), and its cancel button on the left (B) when it released in 1983. But when Sega released the Master System in 1985, it adopted the opposite layout, with its primary 1 button on the left and 2 button on the right.","This doesnt explain how Sonys PlayStation managed to somehow use both, despite having the same controller design across the world. Why would PlayStation developers follow Segas lead in some parts of the world and Nintendos in others?","The original PlayStation controller was very different from the Sega and Nintendo controllers that had come before it. Rather than using letters or numbers that had a clearly defined order, Sony instead used its four now-iconic shapes, meaning developers, in theory, had more choice over how they arranged their controls.","Then, it may have simply been a case of cultural differences between Japan and the West that determined which symbol made sense to be used as the confirm button and which made sense as the cancel button.","In Japan, the O button made the most sense as a confirm button. The X cross shape is known as batsu in Japanese, and it carries similar connotations as it does in the West  no one wants a bunch of Xs on their exam results  but the maru circle shape has a similar meaning to the check mark in Western culture. For example, game shows will display a circle whenever a contestant gets an answer right.","O doesnt have those same positive connotations in the West. So, when it came to picking a controllers confirm button, there wasnt any culturally obvious choice. In its absence, one theory is that developers settled on X because it looks like a target (for example X marks the spot), while the culturally neutral O could be used as cancel. Alternatively, they could have just used the X button because of its placement, which is central and easier to hover over while youre pressing other buttons.","Whatever the reason, the practice seemed to stick with Western developers, and it was further enforced when Microsoft released the original Xbox with its A select button placed in the same place as the X button on Sonys console.","Sony has been happy with each passing console generation to allow its Japanese software to function one way and for its Western software to function another. Even if were no closer to working out exactly where these differences came from, at least the PS4s system software can now accommodate both styles  for Japanese hardware at least.","Next Up In\n    \n        Gaming","Most Read","Command Line","Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.","Loading comments..."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Both organizations are imperative to making sure that our youth stay involved in politics so that there is enough representation in the next generation from all demographics within a party. And although I agree with one organizations message more than the other, I do believe that both do things by the book, and I respect that. But what happens when an organization takes it a step too far? What happens when an organization strays from its mission and becomes a threat to its cause.","Turning Point USA is that organization. Although their mission is to identify, educate, train, and organize students to promote the principles of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government, they have found themselves doing much more than that. Disguised as a grassroots organization that promotes important issues facing the country, they spend most of their time supporting bigots, praising racists, parading their fake diversity, secretly funding college politics, and pushing censorship onto college campuses (the last 2 being the most ironic).","I could spend days writing about how Turning Point USA supports bigots and racists but I dont think it would be productive. Its also extremely easy to notice because they do it openly. They tweet their support for white nationalists and those who support the white ethno-state. Donald Jr., Tomi Lahren are spokespeople for the group. And they believe that having Roy Moores vote in the Senate was more important than the allegations of pedophilia surrounding him and we saw how the black vote in Alabama felt about that. So instead of discussing the obvious, I want to discuss the not so obvious. In this piece, I want to talk about how Turning Point uses diversity to convince their supporters that they are not racist or bigoted, and how that has turned it into one of the fastest growing youth organizations in America.","The word of the day is diversity. College campuses and organizations around the world love taking that picture of a group of minorities having fun and throwing it up on their websites. Whether its my alma mater Dickinson College, or Liam Gallagher in the popular TV show Shameless (a black student constantly taken out of his private school class to be put on the playground during campus tours for parents), people know that organizations parade diversity in an effort to act like they are all inclusive. This is why there was a simultaneous laugh by liberals across the country when Paul Ryans posted a photo on Instagram of the Republican Partys summer interns in 2016. It was so honest and genuine not seeing a single minority in the photo.","Yet supporters were quick to argue that there were light skinned minorities in the group but you just couldnt tell from the photo, and that they had diversity of thought which matters most. Now I wont spend time debating how stupid that last point sounds or that white people with a darker complexion all of a sudden counts as diversity, but Turning Point USA and their organizers know that this is a problem. They know that this attempt to validate diversity of thought in a party that is predominately white wont hold up much longer. They know that to make themselves not seem like the biased organization they are, they must attempt to attract more minorities with these youth outreach programs. They know that to change the fact that more than 80% of blacks have voted democrat for decades, they need to have more prominent black members with their messages. But how do you find minority speakers that preach the same bigoted, racist, and sexist ideologies that your organization promotes? I wish I had the answer to that. Yet somehow they have 6 confirmed (at time of writing) nonwhite speakers at their next convention and we are going to spend this article discussing who these people are, where they come from, and why they are important to keep tabs on.","Speaker #1: Judge Jeanine Pirro is a second-generation Lebanese-American. She has her own segment on Fox News called Justice with Judge Jeanine where she is a hardline Republican who enjoys attempting to blast liberals and call them hypocrites. She has guests on her show such as Sebastian Gorka (hyper conservative anti-LGBTQ Christian) and Ann Coulter (a woman who needs no explanation). She shows disdain for many states like New York, New Jersey, and California purely for being largely democrat. Shes your atypical minority who believes that illegal immigrants should be round up and deported regardless of their contributions and hates those states for having sanctuary cities. Her twitter is filled with segments where she blasts Representative John Conyers, Senator Al Franken, and Matt Lauer (as we all should) but very little (and not negative) mention of Donald Trump and Roy Moore. She loves getting fired up about conspiracy theories that have been shot down numerous times like Uranium One and its relation to Hillary Clinton. She is a Fox News gem and its a way for them to pretend that they are a diverse organization in relation to their political segments.","Speaker #2: Dinesh DSouza is an Indian-American, hyper-conservative Christian, a NYT bestseller, a felon, and a filmmaker adored by the political right. Thats a lot to swallow so we will dissect it a bit. Dinesh didnt come to the United States until he was in college and attended Dartmouth University. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa, he went on to be the editor for The Dartmouth Review in which he ignited controversy by criticizing the colleges affirmative action policies and co-editor for Policy Review in which he criticized liberals for manipulating Catholic bishops to speak out against U.S. military buildup. From 198788, he was a policy adviser for Ronald Reagan, supporter of trickle-down economics, and critic of social welfare. He wrote many books on topics like why the cultural left is responsible for 9/11, why being a feminist is being a hypocrite, and how marriage with a woman civilizes men and same-sex marriage doesnt work. He wrote a film called 2016: Obamas America where he criticizes nearly everything about Obama from his life to his administration. The Associated Press did a fact check on this film and found that little or no evidence exists for most of his claims and many were factually incorrect. And for the cherry on top, in 2014 Dinesh pleaded guilty to one felony count of making illegal contributions in the names of others and received 5 years of probation. Dinesh is a gem for the conservative narrative and it makes sense to see why he would be one of their token speakers.","Speaker #3: Lawrence B Jones III. Out of everybody on my list, LBJ III might be my favorite to talk about and I really hope that I can one day meet this guy. At 24 years old, he is the youngest person on this list but has quite a few accolades to hang on his belt. After voting for Barack Obama and working for the democratic campaign while in school, he educated himself on liberty and pursuing truth which led him to become a conservative. In educating himself on that truth, he worked undercover for Project Veritas (yes the company that got exposed for trying to plant fake stories) to expose fraud of enrolled individuals under the ACA. He also helped raised ~$840,000 for Memories Pizza in 2015, the pizza shop that closed after receiving an immense amount of backlash for saying they wouldnt cater gay weddings. And now as a reporter for the Blaze, he spends his time on twitter using #notallmen arguments and shaming the victims of sexual assault in the work place. Hes a real piece of work and Im glad his educational journey has led him towards the right.","Speaker #4: Antonia Okafor is a pro-gun pro-America, anti-feminist strong independent black woman. Typing that felt like such an oxymoron. How can a self-proclaimed strong black woman be anti-feminist? Ill never know. Regardless, Antonia is a model who considers herself to be the face of the modern gun rights movement, and the reason gun sales for black women have gone up. I personally wouldnt attribute that to you. Id attribute it to the fact that black men and women are being killed at a higher rate because of negligence at the hands of law enforcement. Id contribute it to the fact that Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman who proclaimed he was scared of an unarmed boy. Id contribute it to the fact that black people are tired of being unarmed and still feared, so if we are going to be feared, why not take advantage of our second amendment rights. But I digress. Shes a conservative gun touting black model? Id say thats an easy choice for their party down in Florida.","Speaker #5: Candace Owens is the Director of Urban Engagement for Turning Point USA. She loves saying MAGA on her podcasts. She anti-Colin Kaepernick. And she refers to herself as a reformed liberal after receiving criticism from other progressives during her liberal days. Now, she believes that Black-Americans have a hamster-mentality whenever they vote democrat. That is, they run and run on a wheel, and never get anywhere. For a person that says liberals fear facts, she seems to have many of the wrong facts. Her main argument is that major cities run by democrats like Chicago, are like that because minorities keep voting democrat. This point would make sense, but once you do your research and learn that systemic issues make fixing cities like Chicago easier said than done and that generations of policies against minorities dont get fixed overnight, then her argument makes a lot less sense. And another thing she seems to forget is that people dont vote via race, (hence so many white presidents and congressional representatives) people vote via self-interests. The conservative party does not campaign on minority issues so it makes sense that conservatives dont get the minority vote. So just to reinforce born again conservatives, we add another one to the agenda to join our good friend LBJ III.","Speaker #6: Joy Villa is the token of all tokens. She identifies as African American, Italian, and Choctaw Indian. She enjoys her light skinned privilege that is less harmful to the eyes of hyper-conservatives like Donald and Donald Jr. She made her statement when she went to the Grammys in 2017 sporting a ridiculous make America great again dress. 4 months later she made a song called Make America Great Again that pushed her EP to #1 in digital downloads on Amazon and selling 29,000 album equivalent units. Yet she did not care that this stunt would cause backlash from the minority community because this stunt put her on Donalds radar and her music career had taken off finally. To add to that, Donald is even pushing for her to make a political run for Congress because she is pro-life, pro-gun, and against immigration. She claims her role models are Kellyanne Conway and Donald himself and she believes by supporting Donald, you are supporting winning. No further comments on this woman.","If the conservative party wants people to take their diversity seriously, they need to have more open thinkers. Each minority guest has the exact same storyline and ideology. Conservatives parade around saying that liberals arent open to alternate ideologies (partially true), yet they do the same thing. I refer to them as tokens because they have rooted their beliefs in this ideology that since they were able to succeed, then why havent other minorities done the same, the me vs the rest of them mentality. The reason I find that so troubling is because I used to have the same mindset. I did very well in school growing up and never understood why people still talked about racism. So how do we get more of these kids to swing the way I did, rather than swing the way they did? We have to stop alienating successful minorities. When digging through their past, each of these speakers discussed moments in which they were alienated by their own peers for having different viewpoints. Instead as minorities we must embrace ones success and ones desire to break social norms. We must make it a community mantra to push each other to be the best that we can be. And we have got to stop assuming that just because a minority speaks proper, that they are less black, less Hispanic, etc.","Now am I saying that its wrong for minorities to be conservative? Not at all. I dont think its in your self-interests but its completely up to you what you do with your vote. But I do think its wrong for black people to support an organization like Turning Point USA and an administration like Donalds, while being their diversity talking points. Six minority speakers are good. These six speakers might as well be one person which is ironic for the group that loves to talk about diversity of thought. And 6 minority speakers are irrelevant when this administrations biggest supporters think that as a minority, you provide no positive benefit to being in this country. I would love for any 6 of these individuals to explain to me why they support the conservative party, why it is in their self-interests, and for those who dont entirely support Donald (looking right at you LBJ III), from one minority to another, why support an organization like Turning Point USA that very openly supports people that hate people like you and me?","JJ Jones","Financial advisor.

This week, I will explore lesser-known potential breakout prospects...","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Last week, the 2019 Impact Prospectsdetailed lesser-known potential impactprospects. This week, I will explore lesser-known potential breakout prospects outside the top 200 in the 2019 Top 500 Fantasy Prospects. In this context, a breakout simply means these prospects will greatly improve their fantasy stock over the next year. Some may even vault onto top 100 lists or higher.","Catcher","Luis Campusano, San Diego Padres","Lost behind other notable Low-A catchers (Ronaldo Hernandez, M.J. Melendez, William Contreras, and Miguel Amaya), Luis Campusano quietly enjoyed a strong full-season debut in the Midwest League (.288/.345/.365 with 106 wRC+). In fact, he was the first catcher selected in the 2017 Draft, ahead of M.J. Melendez. While he did not show much game power last year, Campusano possesses plus raw power potential and a quick bat. Further, he impressively limited swing-and-miss (15.1% strikeouts and 9.4% swinging strikes) and showcased a better hit tool than advertised. Unfortunately, a concussion prematurely ended his season in late July. This year, the Padres likely assign Campusano to the more hitter-friendly confines of High-A California League, where he may be the next young catcher to breakout.","Alejandro Kirk, Toronto Blue Jays","Last year, Alejandro Kirk outperformed Wander Franco in the Appalachian League (.354/.444/.558 with 160 wRC+)! In addition, he posted an incredible 21-to-33 strikeout-to-walk ratio with just 5.1% swinging strikes. What is not to like?! The big issue for Kirk is his size (59 and 220 pounds). Indeed, Fangraphs notes one source compared him to Chris Farley.","This is obviously not an ideal body composition for a professional athlete (seeAstudillo, Willians). Regardless, Kirk has shown exceptional promise with the bat and, if he continues to hit in Low-A, it will become easier to overlook his build.","Gabriel Moreno, Toronto Blue Jays","On the other end of the size spectrum, Gabriel Moreno is lithe (510 and 160 pounds) and athletic. Between the Gulf Coast and Appalachian Leagues, he hit .359/.395/.575 with just 12% strikeouts. Moreno possesses advanced bat-to-ball ability and plus bat speed, generating tons of hard, line drive contact (25.6%) to all fields.","Other of Note: Israel Pineda, Washington Nationals","First Base","Ibandel Isabel, Cincinnati Reds","The Reds quietly acquired Ibandel Isabel from the Dodgers early last year. An extreme power-hitter, he arguably possessesas much raw power as any prospect in baseball. Over the last three years, Isabel has amassed an otherworldly 36.5% home run-to-fly ball ratio. This year, he set the home run record in the Florida State League (35), leading the league by 15 home runs! With his massive power, however, comes massive swing-and-miss (36.2% strikeouts and 20.2% swinging strikes). Given his age (23), defensive limitations, and highly questionable hit tool, Isabel is a long shot to become a productive major league asset. The power, though, makes him a worthwhile speculative fantasy investment.","Ryan Noda, Toronto Blue Jays","Last year, Ryan Noda was the top hitter in Low-A Midwest League (160 wRC+) and lead the minors in walks (109, 20.7%). Further, he flashed plus raw power to all fields (18.7% HR/FB). Meanwhile, he also suffered a decent amount of swing-and-miss (25.6% strikeouts and 12.8% swinging strikes), while being old for the level (22). Ultimately, Nola is aprototypical three-true-outcomes slugger without defensive value. While this profile has a low real-life success rate, it can carry significant fantasy value.","Curtis Terry, Texas Rangers","Built like a NFL lineman (63 and 264 pounds), Curtis Terry has power to match his size. Although he won the MVP of the Northwest League (.337/.434/.606 with 186 wRC+), he remains a forgotten prospect. Terry not only hit for power (26.3% HR/FB), but made a ton of hard contact (28.3% line drives) and limited swing-and-miss (9.4% swinging strikes). Still just 22 years old (despite a lengthy 4-year stay in short season ball), he will finally debut in full-season Low-A this year. As a potential DH-only prospect, Terry likely will never receive much attention, but his bat could be special.","Other of Note: Heriberto Hernandez, Texas Rangers","Second Base","Richard Palacios, Cleveland Indians","The brother of Blue Jays prospect Joshua Palacios, Richard was a third round pick in the 2018 Draft. An elite college performer, he hit .301/.457/.515 with 8 home runs, 25 stolen bases, and a 16-to-52 strikeout-to-walk ratio in his junior year. Further, Palacios has a strong track record with wooden bats, most recently hitting .278/.336/.376 in the Cape Cod League. As such, it came as no surprise he dominated the lower minors in his debut (.361/.421/.538). Palacios is a disciplined, line-drive hitter with modest power and an efficient, plus runner.","Tucupita Marcano, San Diego Padres","Over the past two years, Tucupita Marcano has finished among the minor league leaders in strikeout-to-walk ratio (15-to-34 in 2017 and 16-to-30 in 2018). His high-contact, disciplined approach belies his age (19), and leads many observers to assign a future 60-grade to his hit tool. Further, Marcano has above-average speed and enough pop to keep pitchers honest. Whether he develops more power is questionable given his narrow, 60 frame, but his hit tool paired with his speed provides a fairly high fantasy floor. Should he develop double-digit home run power, Marcano is a potential top 50 prospect.","Luis Santana, Houston Astros","The Astros acquired Luis Santana from the Mets for J.D. Davis this January. In his brief professional career, he has never failed to hit, including an impressive .348/.446/.471 line in the Appalachian League. Like Marcano, Santana exhibits a mature, high-contact approach with limited swing-and-miss (9.5% strikeouts and 6.5% swinging strikes). However, he has a small, nearly fully-developed 58 frame, which does not promise much power potential. Still, Santana can hit, he has some speed, and some pop.","Other of Note: Alberto Figuereo, Tampa Bay Rays","Third Base","Sherten Apostel, Texas Rangers","The player-to-be-named-later in theKeone Kelatrade with the Pirates, Sherten Apostel is an abundantly projectable, 64 slugger. Already, he flashes big power (22.8% HR/FB) and he projects to plus or better raw power at maturity. In addition, he displays an all-fields, patient approach (18.3% walk rate) and very reasonable swing-and-miss given his long levers (11.6% swinging strikes). At his best, Apostel looks the part of a future fantasy superstar with an average-to-above hit tool and plus game power. However, his swing length gives pause on such an aggressive grade for his hit tool and he likely will struggle with contact as he climbs the ladder. Ultimately, Apostels profile could develop any number of ways, and it is reasonable to expect a three-true-outcomes slugger at first base.","Miguel Vargas, Los Angeles Dodgers","Nearly two years after Miguel Vargas defected from Cuba, the Dodgers signed him for $300,000 in September 2017. In his debut, he obliterated the Arizona and Pioneer Leagues, before crashing and burning over his last 10 games in Low-A (2-for-27). Overall, Vargas showcased advanced hitting ability, with a disciplined, all-fields approach. In addition, he is projectable (63 and 198 pounds), and observers anticipate he will develop average-to-above raw power.","CJ Alexander, Atlanta Braves","The older brother of fellow 2018 draftee Blaze Alexander, CJ was a 20th round selection from junior college. Like his younger brother, he had a fantastic debut (.352/.429/.495 with 27.3% line drives), even reaching High-A. His large 65 frame generates plus raw power, and he has sneaky hitting ability due to an efficient, all-fields stroke. Despite his lower draft position, Alexander has solid fantasy potential.","Other of Note: Diosbel Arias, Texas Rangers","Shortstop","Brayan Rocchio, Cleveland Indians","Brayan Rocchio is a less-heralded member of a huge 2017 international class for the Indians, including Aaron Bracho and George Valera. While Bracho and Valera succumbed to injuries in their debuts, Rocchio blew through the Dominican Summer and Gulf Coast Leagues (.335/.390/.442). A switch-hitter, he has elite bat-to-ball skills and barrel control from both sides of the plate. As such, many project him to be a plus hitter with plus speed. Additionally, he has plenty of remaining projection (though, a narrow frame) to develop double-digit home run power.","Geraldo Perdomo, Arizona Diamondbacks","In his stateside debut, Geraldo Perdomo made quick work of three short season levels (.322/.438/.460). A switch-hitter, he makes consistent hard contact to all fields from both sides of the plate. Further, he has solid power potential, emanating from his projectable 62 frame.Not only can Perdomo hit, but he can also field, making him a prime candidate to fly up rankings.","Wenceel Perez, Detroit Tigers","The Tigers signed Perez for $550,000 in 2016. In his stateside debut this year, he blitzed through three levels to full-season Low-A (.312/.363/.429). Notably, Perez displayed a potential plus hit tool, with a disciplined, high-contact approach and a feel for all-fields contact. In addition, he has plus speed and athleticism, and most observers project him to stick at shortstop long-term. Whether he develops meaningful power is uncertain, and, currently, his raw power is well-below-average.","Others of Note: Shervyen Newton, New York Mets; Antoni Flores, Boston Red Sox; Osleivis Basabe, Texas Rangers","Outfield","Jhon Torres, St. Louis Cardinals","The Cardinals acquired Jhon Torres from the Indians as part of the package for Oscar Mercado. After joining his new organization, he laid waste to the Gulf Coast League (.397/.493/.683). Torres is a potential special bat, with the ability to hit and hit for big power.","Moises Gomez, Tampa Bay Rays","At just 19 years old, Moises Gomez was one of the top hitters in the Midwest League (.280/.328/.503). He is a prototypical corner outfield power hitter with plus raw power and a leveraged swing to tap into most of it. An aggressive hitter, however, Gomez suffers substantial swing-and-miss (26.6% strikeouts and 16.8% swinging strikes).","Dylan Carlson, St. Louis Cardinals","A first round pick from the 2016 Draft, Dylan Carlson quietly made a lot of progress this year. Specifically, he significantly reduced his swing-and-miss (17.7% strikeouts and 11% swinging strikes) and boosted his game power (.144 ISO and 9.2% HR/FB), all while playing in the Florida State League.","Others of Note:Mariel Bautista, Cincinnati Reds; Daniel Montano, Colorado Rockies; Niko Decolati, Colorado Rockies; Leandro Cedeno, St. Louis Cardinals; Joerlin De Los Santos, St. Louis Cardinals; Anthony Garcia, New York Yankees; Diego Rincones, San Francisco Giants; Wilderd Patino, Arizona Diamondbacks; Pablo Abreu, Milwaukee Brewers","Pitcher","Tony Gonsolin, Los Angeles Dodgers","The former reliever flourished last year in his transition to a starting role (2.60/1.14 ERA/WHIP with 155 strikeouts in 128 innings). Most importantly, his repertoire matches his performance, with a mid-90s fastball and three average-to-above secondaries (slider, curveball, and splitter). While his control is solid (8% BB), Tony Gonsolin has below-average command and a high-effort delivery.","Roansy Contreras, New York Yankees","At just 18 years old, Roansy Contreras breezed through the New York-Penn League and Low-A (2.42/1.03 ERA/WHIP) behind a huge, mid-to-upper-90s fastball and a power curveball. However, his size (60) and present command are not ideal.","Clarke Schmidt, New York Yankees","A first round pick in the 2017 Draft, Clarke Schmidt did not make his professional debut until last June due to recovery from Tommy John surgery. Based on early results, it appears his stuff has fully returned, including four potential average-to-above offerings (low-to-mid-90s fastball, curveball, slider, and change-up).","Jordan Holloway, Miami Marlins","Like Schmidt, Jordan Holloway missed most of the season due to recovery from Tommy John surgery. His recovery and brief, five-game return last year went so well the Marlins added him to the 40-man roster. Indeed, Holloway has an electric arm, dialing up upper-90s fastballs and a potential plus curveball. Should his change-up and command improve, he is a potential top-of-the-rotation arm.","Brailyn Marquez, Chicago Cubs","A projectable 64 left-handed pitcher, Brailyn Marquez already sits in the mid-90s with a promising curveball, change-up, and command.","Zack Burdi, Chicago White Sox","A future closer, Burdi unfortunately underwent Tommy John surgery in July 2017. When healthy, he possesses an elite, upper-90s fastball, a wipeout slider, and a tumbling changeup.","Others of Note: Bryan Abreu, Houston Astros; Luis Gil, New York Yankees; Mauricio Llovera, Philadelphia Phillies; Carlos Vargas, Cleveland Indians; Tahnaj Thomas, Pittsburgh Pirates; Gerardo Carrillo, Los Angeles Dodgers; Luis Rijo, Minnesota Twins; Gregory Santos, San Francisco Giants; Victor Santos, Philadelphia Phillies; Ronny Hernandez, Texas Rangers","Jesse Roche's 2019 Prospect Series","Date","Article","11/5/18","Top 600 Dynasty League Players, Fall Preview","11/12/18","2019 Top 40 Fantasy Catcher Prospects","11/19/18","2019 Top 30 Fantasy First Base Prospects","11/26/18","2019 Top 30 Fantasy Second Base Prospects","12/3/18","2019 Top 40 Fantasy Third Base Prospects","12/10/18","2019 Top 70 Fantasy Shortstop Prospects, Part 1","12/17/18","2019 Top 70 Fantasy Shortstop Prospects, Part 2","12/24/18","2019 Top 140 Fantasy Outfield Prospects, Part 1","12/31/18","2019 Top 140 Fantasy Outfield Prospects, Part 2","1/7/19","2019 Top 210 Fantasy Pitching Prospects, Part 1","1/16/19","2019 Top 210 Fantasy Pitching Prospects, Part 2","1/21/19","Upon Further Review: Notable Grade Changes","1/28/19","2019 Top 500 Fantasy Prospects","2/11/19","2019 Top 100 Upside-Only Fantasy Prospects","2/20/19","2019 First Year Player Draft Rankings","3/11/19","2019 Impact Prospects","3/18/19","2019 Breakout Prospects","4/1/19","Prospects Breaking Camp","4/3/19","Monthly Prospect Update: Infielders, March 2019","4/4/19","Monthly Prospect Update: Outfielders, March 2019","4/5/19","Monthly Prospect Update: Pitchers, March 2019","4/8/19","2019 MLB Draft Fantasy Prospects","PLEASE FEEL FREE TO POST COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, OR YOUR OWN OBSERVATIONS!","FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER @JAROCHE6","Share this:","Like this:","The Author","Jesse Roche","Jesse is an attorney, currently residing in Greensboro.

These envenomations can result in severe pain despite aggressive analgesia due to effects of venom toxins. We report a case in which we treated a 44- year-old man who sustained a Copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) bite to his left hallux with progressive local toxicity, including severe pain radiating into his upper leg, without evidence of compartment syndrome or coagulopathy. His pain was unresponsive to multiple doses of opioids. We performed a fascia iliaca compartment femoral nerve block under dynamic ultrasound guidance with 20mL of 0.25% bupivacaine, which provided substantial pain relief in his upper leg. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of regional anesthesia with peripheral nerve block. We demonstrate fascia iliaca compartment femoral nerve block may be a safe, beneficial technique for emergency physicians to utilize in providing multimodal analgesia in Crotalid envenomation.","PMID","Full text","Similar articles"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Cowardice. But I believe Miami now has the right leadership in place  in owner Stephen Ross, personnel chief Chris Grier and coach Brian Flores  to overcome any fear of distraction or backlash.","Heck, the Dolphins have struggled to be nationally relevant, to be interesting, since Dan Marino retired. Signing Kaepernick would foist Miami back onto the radar. It would be a jolt of electricity to enliven a franchise that could dearly use one.","The Dolphins are not looking for a savior or long-term answer here. They are looking for a stopgap, a temporary bridge that gets Miami from Ryan Tannehill, the longtime incumbent who was traded Friday to Tenerssee, to the franchise QB they hope to draft this April or in 2020.","Kaepernick, a motivated, low-mileage 31 after last playing in 2016, is the perfect bridge.","The Dolphins went after Tyrod Taylor in free agency, but failed to convince him that starting for a year in Miami was a better gig than backing up Philip Rivers in Los Angeles.","The Dolphins then went after Teddy Bridgewater, a Miami native and lifelong Dolphins fan, but he opted to re-sign with New Orleans as Drew Brees backup.","(These are further indications the perception is that Miami, rebuilding, is headed for a rough season).","Kaepernick is arguably better than Taylor and Bridgewater but not to such a degree you risk being too good and ruining your shot at a high draft pick in 2020. Kaepernick also does not have the same fallback option to easily turn down a Miami offer. If he wants to play again  and he says he does  this could be a buyers market for the Dolphins. Unconfirmed reports he was demanding $20 million to play in the new Alliance of American Football sounded ridiculous. (But thats still less than the the $26.6 million salary cap hit if the Fins keep Tannehill another year).","The dwindling market of other available experienced arms includes Blake Bortles, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brock Osweiler, but they are not better options than Kaepernick  only safer ones, because only Kaepernick is polarizing.","Miami is a perfect fit because Kaepernick is a dual-threat QB whose versatility is adaptable.","Miami also is a perfect fit because, led by Kenny Stills, the Dolphins more than any other NFL team have carried forth what Kaepernick began in 2016 by first kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police shootings of unarmed young black men. What was a symbolic demand for social justice was off-putting to many who saw it as anti-flag, but that misplaced outrage seems to be dissipating.","It also bears noting that Ross is a progressive owner whose RISE project  Ross Initiative In Sports for Equality  was created to eliminate racial discrimination, champion social justice and improve race relations. Those are exactly the aims of the protest movement Kaepernick founded. Signing this quarterback would champion Ross RISE initiative like nothing else has.","Might the signing upset some? Sure. Including perhaps some Cuban-American who would point out that Kaepernick once wore a T-shirt depicting a meeting between Malcolm X and Fidel Castro. (The QBs only praise of Castro was to note the money spent on education there).","Kaepernick is an activist, yes. He is a political man. He believes some things are more important than football.","Sometimes lost in the equation, he also is a quarterback eager to play again.","He is allowed to be all of those things, if the NFL  or one brave team  will let him.","Related stories from  Miami Herald","miami-dolphins","Miami Dolphins trade Ryan Tannehill to the Titans, get valuable asset in return","armando-salguero","Miami Dolphins quarterback decisions, so terrible this century, finally on right path","barry-jackson","What the Tannehill trade does for Miamis future cap flexibility","miami-dolphins","Podcast: Breaking down Dolphins quarterback situation (its not as bad as you think)","Comments","Videos","Behind the scenes with Dan Le Batard","Greg Cote's Back in My Day: Halloween!","Trending Stories","Man dies in Miami after Mexican star punches him in traffic incident.

On writing the sex scene: https://t.co/QWRC8Iojpi https://t.co/ZhLuHhBtU7"],"postMedia":["D06AszrWwAAIKPQ.jpg"],"targetTitle":"Let's Not Get It On: The Indefensible Sex Scene - The Millions","targetDescription":"Literature about sex, no matter who has written it, is almost always terrible, and everybody knows it.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Related Books:","Literature about sex, no matter who has written it, is almost always terrible, and everybody knows it. This is widely known and acknowledged  even on this very site, by both the great Sonya Chung and Julia Fierro. Were all so tuned into its legendary badness that even relatively minor offenses in the realm of sex writing annoy us far more than other writerly transgressions. An imperfect depiction of sex is far worse for some reason than an inept description of someone entering a room or having a marital spat or whatever other things a book might get wrong without anyone disapproving quite so mercilessly.","There is sufficient scorn for bad sex writing that the Literary Review famously awards an annual prize for it. Though prize seems like a funny term for becoming the object of public ridicule and mockery. Its a missing component of the human brain, the ability to recognize ones own completely botched attempts at writing about penetration, blow jobs, and the rest of it. Most writers, one must assume, push themselves away from their desks at the end of their earnest writing sessions and think to themselves, Job well done. Only to discover a few months or years later that they have gone and humiliated themselves, at least according to a bunch of smug bastards on the other side of the ocean.","Which isnt to say Im not in sympathy with the smug bastards. In writing my own book full of sex, there was almost no one I could turn to for inspiration. There wasnt a single book I looked to and thought, What Im trying to do is write sex like she did or like he did. There werent even movies and TV shows I felt had handled it the way I wanted to see it done. You know what movies and TV shows are really brilliant at capturing? Bad sex. Theyre great at doing awkward, depressing, uncomfortable sex scenes where everyone is sort of strangled in the sheets, and the women are keeping their breasts covered, and everyone is obviously faking their orgasms and not getting what they want. And you know that the movie is probably about a breakup that hasnt happened yet but soon will.","The other thing that movies and TV shows are good at nailing down is the kind of phonily intense sex scene in which the involved parties are grabbing fistfuls of hair and grunting and slamming each other around because their passion, their chemistry, is so overpowering it cant be softened by courtesy, affection, or fear of causing actual physical harm. Often, the players in these scenes remain largely clothed, too ravenous for one anothers genitals to waste time undressing. They merely make a path towards penetration, him through his fly, her with underwear stretched between her thighs or, better yet, ripped and lying in tatters nearby. This type of sex scene is perhaps best exemplified by a sequence in David Cronenbergs A History of Violence in which the two (needless to say, gorgeous) leads have a ferocious and impassioned sexual encounter on a wooden staircase  quite possibly the worst place on the planet to have sex. The only version of this scene I could find on YouTube is dubbed in another language, but the familiarity of such brutal fucking transcends language, and should be familiar to anyone who sees it.","Though my own sex scenes werent written with titillation in mind, if I had to choose a point of inspiration for them, a certain kind of amateur pornography comes closest, the kind where you actually believe theyve forgotten the camera is there, and the effect is that of a documentary. Or maybe even hidden camera porn, where one guy seems to know theyre being recorded, but the other fellow seems not to know. And they experience a kind of typical sex exchange that feels true somehow. Even thought its not, of course, true at all, and might in fact be so deceptive as to be unethical and/or illegal. The ordinariness of their interaction is what is so striking. Stripped of performance and professional lighting, moments like these can never be accused of the most common pitfalls of bad sex writing: pretension, mushiness, cornball romance, those absurd oh-yeah-you-like-that-dont-you, uh-huh-you-know-I-do-big-daddy exchanges.","While I am somewhat in sympathy with the smug bastards calling out the writers who do it badly, I experience an even greater depth of fellow feeling for those who have tried to get it right and failed. Because its really hard getting it right, if it can be done at all. Everyone knows what sex is like, and we all know that, almost always, somethings off in the way its described on the page. How seldom it is truly captured  the physical sensation, the feelings, the smells. Yes, there are smells! Tasteful writers dont mention them, but theyre there, and they can fill a room. And this  gentility  is perhaps the worst offense of all when writing about sex. How can you take me there if the word loins is used even once? How can you take me there if you wont admit that there are smells? And pubic hairs that must occasionally be plucked from the tip of your tongue or hocked up discreetly in the shower sometime later.","Im no different than anyone else who has waded into this treacherous territory. Im quite happy with my sex scenes. I think theyre just terrific, actually. I think theyre right in their frankness, in their zooming in and zooming out. In the smells they attempt to conjure and fan out at readers from the page, however subtly. I think they capture something real and true. But we all know what the odds say about the likelihood of their success. Take the Magic Eight Ball in hand, give it a shake, and ask the question. Wait a moment for the answer to bob up through inky, blue waters and flatten against the window. Outlook not so good.","Drew Nellins Smith\nhas written about books for many places.

McEwan has a scientists eye for detail, and a certain amount of clinical dispassion seems to lend itself to writing about sex well.","Seconded. The library scene in Atonement was brilliant.","Great sex scene in Jesus Son between Crudup and Hunter.","My nom was worst sex writer is Paul Auster, who, despite his obvious brilliance, continues to write sex scenes between old men who are invalids and beautiful blonde women in which the men are still studs in spit of their infirmaries. This tic of his is why I will never cop to him being one of my favorites writers. He is still way too invested in his virility for me to take him seriously.","Like taking a shit, lets leave sex scenes out of novels. Allude to sex, but dont write it. I end up just saying yucko. Having said that, I am reading The Seed Collectors by Scarlett Thomas and she (so far) writes, alludes, to sex rather well because she is funny as hell about it.","Like taking a shit, lets leave sex scenes out of novels.","Dont know what kind of sex youre familiar with, HC (laugh) but Id compare sex to another natural necessity (and aestheticized pleasure) such as *eating* and why should there be a prohibition against portraying it or a tendency to freight its portrayal with mystical (or grandiose) nature metaphors that obscure, rather than reveal, its essence? Sex is always a dialogue (though its not always an articulate, imaginative or friendly one) and dialogues are natural to the novel.","Like taking a shit, lets leave sex scenes out of novels. Allude to sex, but dont write it. I end up just saying yucko. Having said that, I am reading The Seed Collectors by Scarlett Thomas and she (so far) writes, alludes, to sex rather well because she is funny as hell about it.","Tastefully withdrawing before the sex occurs is the usual tack, and it works pretty well. That said, Im all for sex scenes if the author is good at writing them and if the scene is germane to the overall narrative. In the same sense, Im not even opposed to a good (it better be really good) taking a shit sceneJoyces scene with Bloom in the outhouse is one of the best in Ulysses.","Oh man! Page 68 of Scarlett Thomass The Seed Collectors: He shits in the spare toilet before joining her. The rest of the paragraph is pretty funny, so Scarlett gets a pass. Steve Garvey, no doubt Joyce got it right but the fact that youve read Ulysses shows you are way out of my league, I just cant get through it.

Most people understand basic open meeting laws, however, not every meeting is exactly like the next. How do you know if the meeting is in compliance for the public? How do you know if the governing body is being transparent?","Transparency is a way of protecting the citizens and ensuring fairness. If officials want citizens to trust them, they have to be open about what they are doing. People want to know how their money is being spent and why.","Other questions commonly asked include:","What constitutes a meeting under the Open Meeting Law?","Can I call a commissioner or board member individually about a pending matter?","What types of meetings may be closed under the Open Meeting Law? (Executive Session)","Who enforces the Open Meeting Law?","Where can you, the citizen, get answers?","There are many resources online. We will highlight a few here for you. While most of this information is geared towards the State of Idaho, many apply to all states and governing bodies.

You can see it here: Frequently Asked Questions about Open Meetings","The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press has published some fine work on the subject. Here is their take on Nongovernmental bodies receiving public funds or benefits:","Idaho","The question of whether nongovernmental bodies that receive public funds or benefits are subject to the provisions of the Idaho Open Meeting Law has not been addressed by any appellate court in Idaho.","The application of the Open Meeting Law to such bodies probably turns upon whether the body was created by some public act (such as a statute, ordinance or other legislative act), rather than upon whether governmental officials who might otherwise be subject to the act are included in its membership or upon whether public funds are received by the body.","Hence, a meeting of State Department of Health and Welfare officials that results in state grant monies being provided to a privately operated shelter home would probably be subject to the Open Meeting Law.","However, a meeting of the board of the privately run shelter home (even if the board included one or more of those same officials which had helped make the decision to send public grant monies to the shelter home) would probably not be subject to the law since the shelter home does not exist or was not created by the virtue of any statute, ordinance or other public act.","Idaho Counties Risk Management Program (ICRMP) has put together a well done document explaining and answering the most common questions concerning Executive Sessions.","Here you will find answers to questions including:","What are common reasons to go into Executive Session?"," Idaho Code 74-206(1)"," Personnel selection and evaluation  Idaho Code 74-206(1)(a) and (b)"," Acquire interest in real property  Idaho Code 74-206(1)(c)"," Consider records exempt from disclosure  Idaho Code 74-206(1)(d)"," Discuss litigation  with your attorney  Idaho Code 74-206(1)(f)"," Consider claims or potential claims  with your risk manager or insurer  Idaho Code 74-206(1)(i)","Reference:","Open Meeting Law Manual  Common Reasons to go Into Executive Session","What can be discussed in executive session?","Only subjects identified within the motion to enter the executive session and outlined in the specific subsections of Idaho Code 74-206 authorizing the executive session can be discussed in executive session.","Reference:","Idaho Code 74-206","What topics cannot be discussed in Executive Session?","Its a violation to change the subject within the executive session to one not identified within the motion to enter the executive session or to any topic for which an executive session is not provided.

These are typical numbers for the middle of January.","Environment Canada is looking for the real warming trend to begin close to March 20. His departments outlook calls for warmer-than-usual weather from mid-March to mid-April.","So its coming. Its just a slow March, Phillips said.","Ottawa city crews blast ice south of the Minto bridges on the Rideau River on Monday in advance of the annual spring thaw to prevent flooding.\n\n\nTony Caldwell /  \n\nOTTwp","Last year went from an unusually cold April into the warmest May on record. That will not happen this spring, Phillips said, and the Weather Network and the U.S. National Weather Service agree on this outlook.","We are due.","While this winter hasnt had extremes of cold (the lowest was a single night at 26) Phillips notes that winter started early and hasnt taken a break.","We havent had a high of 10 or more since Nov. 7.","Thats a long period for Ottawa. Thats fine for Edmonton or Saskatoon, he said.","There has been snow on the ground since Nov. 12, so you have never seen the ground for 111 days or so.","There is a lot of snow sitting on the ground, he said. The depth is 62 cm; Ottawa has had 263 cm of snow this winter; the average for this date is 174 cm. I worry about the flood issue. We certainly wont want spring rains.","We have had no significant January or February thaws. We have had many days when the temperature rose just above freezing for a few hours, but no real warmth. These thaws are too brief to drain away water, and instead they have given us ice.","February had 13 of these melt days. Thats a lot.","Spring officially starts at 5:58 p.m. on March 20, when the sun will cross the equator and keep heading north.","On that date, the sun will appear 44.5 degrees above our horizon at noon. When winter began, it rose only 21 degrees above the horizon.","Both the Canadian and U.S. weather services count spring as the period from March 1 to May 31, and never mind about equinoxes and solstices. They calculate statistics for entire seasons, and its a lot easier to work with whole months than with fractions, especially when spring can start on March 20 some years and on March 21 or 22 in other years.","Besides, they argue, March is less wintry than December, so it makes sense to count all of December as winter, and none of March as winter. Summer and fall work the same way  three whole months start June 1 and Sept. 1.","You can even make a case that spring starts on March 18. That is the date when we first get 12 full hours of daylight.

Since the games announcement back in 2013, fans have been left to wonder how complex of an experience it will be. At the very least, many got a better idea about its tone when Cyberpunk 2077was finally shown off during Microsofts E3 2018 Press Conference. While the news showed signs of substantial progress on the project, it seems as if CD Projekt Red has no intentions on rushing the game out prematurely.","In a recent developer documentary for CD Projekt Red on PlayStations YouTube channel, the video ends with a brief statement that reiterates Cyberpunk 2077 is Coming: When Its Ready. The team has already compared its development approach and expectations to some of the most popular games to release in the past few years, indicating the studio is setting a high bar of quality.","From an internal perspective, Cyberpunk 2077 is intended to allow players to take on quests deemed as complex as those found in 2015s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. On the topic of polish and visuals, CD Projekt Red has drawn on the success of Rockstars Red Dead Redemption 2 as the benchmark in quality for inspiration. Given those high standards the development team hopes Cyberpunk 2077 is able to achieve, a prolonged development schedule appears to be the clear approach.","Between hints from the likes of the games publisher, Warner Bros. Interactive, and a possible release date leak from this past Valentines Day, its unlikely anyone will get the chance to roam the streets of Night City in 2019. Even then, fans and press are still excited for what the final version ofCyberpunk 2077will look and feel like.","This past summer, CD Projekt Red released what was originally a behind-closed-doors 48-minute gameplay demo for Cyberpunk 2077.In the footage, the public was finally given a look at some of the finer details of gunplay, exploration, and customization options players should look forward to when the game eventually releases.","While the timeline for a set release date is likely a ways off, CD Projekt Red has confirmedCyberpunk 2077 will return to E3 this year. Given the reception of the trailer which capped off Microsofts Conference last year, there is a strong chance the game will be returning to the big Xbox showcase. And although CD Projekt Red has stated previously it is aiming to releaseCyberpunk 2077on current generation hardware, there is always the possibility of it coming out for next-gen systems.","Cyberpunk 2077is expected to launch on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, but does not have an official release date yet.","Source: PlayStation  YouTube"],"targetCaptions":[]}

But that time is gone. The Larry Nassar scandal and rising backlash against bullying make what Izzo did during Thursday's NCAAtournament game feel more uncomfortable and more risky.","Izzo loyalists, who include much of the press, dismiss the raging bull episode as part of the Michigan State University coach's schtick  the way he motivates his players, the way he teaches them to win.","\"That's just Izzo,\" they say. \"That's the way he's always been.\"","But there's no grandfather clause for abusive conduct. Just because he's got away with it for decades, doesn't mean it won't bite MSU in the butt today.","The world has changed. There's nothing funny about watching someone in a position of authority berate, intimidate and humiliate one of his charges.","Izzo's outburst during the winagainst Bradley went beyond a coach dressing down a player. That happens with nearly every coach, in every game, at least at the collegiate level.In the pros, where players are more empowered, there's more restraint.","Izzo approached freshman Aaron Henry, who'd been slacking on defense, as if he intended to physically attack him. Later, in a sideline huddle, the coach lunged out of his chair at Henry, who was trying to plead his case..","In both instances, other players got between the coach and Henry, moving Izzo back.","It appeared on television as if Izzo was just an impulse away from a career-ending Bobby Knight or Woody Hayes moment. He seemed unhinged.","Maybe he was actually under control, as his devotees insist, and it was all part of a carefully considered act. I've not covered Izzo, and don't know him.","But still, MSU should be worried that Izzo, like Knight, who famously threw a chair, and Hayes, who punched an opposing player, will cross the line during one of his red-faced rages and do something to further sully the university's reputation.","While they may be playing on a big-time stage, these players are still basically kids. Henry isa teen-ager. The freshman shrugged off the incident after the game, saying he faces worse during practices.","If that's true, Izzo and his program need a lot more oversight from a university administration that will pay the price if he snaps.","But don't hold your breath.

From the Washington Examiner:","Fired FBI agent Peter Strzok told Congress last year that the agency did not have access to Clinton Foundation emails that were on Hillary Clintons private server because of a consent agreement negotiated between the Department of Justice attorneys and counsel for Clinton.","That agreement was revealed in newly released congressional transcripts from Strzoks closed-door testimony at the House Judiciary Committee on June 27, 2018.","When asked by then-majority general counsel Zachary Somers if the Clinton Foundation was on the server, Strzok testified that he believed it was on one of the servers, if not the others. But Strzok stressed that due to an agreement between the DOJ and Clinton, they were not allowed to search Clinton Foundation emails for information that could help in their investigation.","The FBI would have been investigating Clintons emails in 2016, when former President Barack Obama was still in office and when Clinton was running for president against then-candidate Donald Trump.","Somers asked in the 2018 hearing: Were you given access to those emails as part of the investigation?","Strzok replied: We were not. We did not have access, according to the transcript.","The FBIs investigation into Clinton, called the Midyear Exam, focused on whether she had mishandled classified information in emails that were sent and received through her private server.","Strzok testified that according to the [DOJ] attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.","Strzok testified that the FBI did not have immediate access to Clintons servers, but rather obtained possession of the servers over time.","Although the FBI would eventually gain possession of Clintons server, it was only according to terms negotiated with Clintons lawyers. Strzok said that the FBI had it voluntarily in the context  in the case of the servers, voluntarily in the context of consent that was worked out between DOJ attorneys and counsel for Secretary Clinton.","Strzok testified that the FBIs ability to search these emails was constrained. He said that there was a significant filter team that was put in place to work through the various terms of the various consent agreements.","He listed just some of the restrictions placed on the FBIs search of Clintons emails: Those could be  and this is not an exclusive list  limits of domains, of date ranges, of people. But thats not an exclusive list.","Despite those constraints, Strzok said the FBI was being aggressive in its investigation.","The FBI team was certainly, I think, comparatively aggressive, which is my experience, he said. Agents tend to be much more aggressive in trying to get information. Prosecutors look at it from a different set of perspectives.","RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","Joe Biden Finds Skeleton In Obamas Closet, Ruthlessly Exposes It To Save Flailing Campaign","Joe Biden Slams Barack Obama And What Obama Did To USA (Video)","Rush Limbaugh Finds Skeleton In Medias Closet, Publicly Exposes It To Help Trump","LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply","Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."],"targetCaptions":[]}

It was one of the largest and most grotesque attacks targeting the Muslim community to date. And the shooter made it clear that it was a racist, xenophobic terrorist attack.","Moments before the mass shooting,an anonymous 8chan user shared a post on the imageboards politics board, /pol/, claiming that its time to stop shitposting and time to make a real life effort post. That same user shared a series of links to a 74-page manifesto calledThe Great Replacement. Penned by an Australian 28-year-old named Brenton Tarrant, the main suspect arrested in connection with the mosque shootings, the manifesto is filled with tongue-in-cheek bigotry and irony, mirroring 8chans sense of humor. In one passage, Tarrant posts the Navy Seal copypasta. In another section, he calls himself a kebab removalist.","None of this rhetoric surprised /pol/. There were no users claiming his post was too edgy or that his actions are reprehensible. No, in 8chans eyes, Tarrant is based. He is the real deal. All this is a joke, and the punchline is 49 deaths.","HAHAHA HE PLAYED REMOVE KEBAB EN ROUTE! one /pol/ user wrote. IM DYIN OVER HERE!","","8chan","If you want to understand 8chan, youll have to first go to 4chan. And to understand 4chan is to know Gamergate.","In late August 2014, actor and conspiracy theorist Adam Baldwin kicked off the hashtag #Gamergateon Twitter, mobilizing gamers over a series of articles criticizing white male entitlement in the gaming world. Gamergate uncorked political issues festering under gamings surface, revealing an ongoing divide between reactionary gamers and the women, queer folks, and people of color who held up the industry. Gamergatebecame a battle between the left vs. right on Twitter, Reddit,and 4chan, and its conversations werent just theoretical: Gamergaters saw certain key people, such as Feminist FrequencysAnita Sarkeesianand her criticism, as gamings problem.","By September 2014, 4chans moderation team realized things were getting out of hand.Citing4chans rules against posting personal information/raids/calls to invasion, 4chans founder and then-admin Christopher moot Poole said Gamergate had outgrown 4chan. He apologized to /v/ users, and across the site, Gamergate discussions were effectively banned.","This sent /v/ and /pol/s Gamergate supporters into a frenzy. Many users began a mass exodus to a little-known imageboard created the year before: 8chan.","I followed [8chan] pretty closely during its rise, Twitter user @voidgndr (who uses voi/void and they/them pronouns) told the Daily Dot. It was Weird? Like, actively watching this website Id used for years that was just fucking abhorrent finally reach such a fever pitch that someone finally had to step in and moderate, and then the userbase just fucking split.","8chan was originally founded by computer programmer Fredrick Hot Wheels Brennan, who wanted to create a website dedicated to free speech, anonymity, and custom user boards, according to a Daily Dot report from 2017.For fleeing Gamergaters,8chans appeal was obvious. The imageboard only has one global rule: Do not post, request, or link to any content that is illegal in the United States of America and do not create boards with the purpose of posting or spreading such content.","8chan","While there are a couple of adjacent rules for board owners, 8chans global admins otherwise letmods run their own imageboard communities as they please. No one will stop you if you post racial slurs, organize a dogpile against a games journalist on Twitter, or share someones dox. YouTuber Dan Olson, a prominent 8chan critic who unveiled its problems with pedophilia, claims 8chan was pretty much always this bad and friendly to the far-right since day 1.","While 4chans neo-Nazi problem is something that has festered and grown over the years through a mix of apathy and complacency, 8chan pretty much came out the gate courting extremists, Olson told the Daily Dot. Like, 4chan is an awful place, but there is still a level of overt white nationalism that will get you banned. Its a high bar, but it exists. 8chan was promoting to the people who felt 4chan was too cucked.'","Gamergate cycled through a couple of imageboards at first. These days, discussions mostly reside on a Gamergate thread on 8chans /v/, where lists for current tasks, resources, and more are shared. Ongoing campaigns are called operations and given tongue-in-cheek names. For instance, Gamergaters are currently trying to contact the United Nations to counteract a U.N. protocol calling for a ban on child pornography in all forms, including drawings and cartoons. That operation is called OP Locked and Lolid: Striking Back Against the U.N. Loli Ban.","8chan didnt invent operations. The name goes back to the early days of Anonymous on 4chan. But 8chans Gamergate community is bizarrely intense, even by Gamergate standards.Anonymous users talk about the gaming industry almost as if theyre at war, with battles taking place across the internet against everyone from women in games to the U.N. Its an us vs. them mindset, one that proved too much even for some Gamergaters.","Twitter user@RinaIsBadsupported Gamergate when 8chan first blew up years ago, although she initially saw the imageboard as just a temporary tool and a shittier, slightly edgier version of 4chan. She later left Gamergate after she felt it stopped caring about the industry itself and instead hyperfixated on the ideology of people as if that in and of itself was the issue. These days, she doesnt have any kind words to spare 8chan.","As years went by, and more batshit insane stuff started appearing [on 8chan], like the Qanon shit, and the general /pol/ /b/-ishness of literally everything posted on every subject, the whole place seemed like a dumpster fire of people who took the pretending to be an asshole thing way too far, @RinaIsBad told the Daily Dot. At some point, shit went from, Im just pretending to be a racist psycho, to I actually am a white nationalist lunatic.'","8chan","This didnt happen in a vacuum. While one can debate whether Gamergate started as a right-wing movement, it became one de facto early on. By September 2014, BreitbartsMilo Yiannopoulos started reporting on Gamergate, and many supporters flocked to his side (Disclosure: Yiannopoulos was the founder of the Kernel, a publication the Daily Dot acquired in 2014.). Not everyone was comfortable with Yiannopoulos, but making bedfellows with the then-editor proved convenient: He could give legitimacy to Gamergate. In turn, his support opened the floodgates to more right-wing radicalization among Gamergates members. Gradually, Gamergaters further doubled down on the right as Yiannopulos became a celebrity among them.","Almost every thread [on 8chan] was GG-related starting out, which makes sense given the timing, @voidgndr told the Daily Dot. A lot of people just mocking SJWs and stuff, the kind of shit you see on [internet stalking forum Kiwi Farms] today. A LOT of doxing too. It was vicious, I mean, but it was honestly probably the tamest it ever was, insane as it is to say that. [] Like, they were still literal fucking Nazis, but they at least downplayed it.","It would be a stretch to say Gamergate caused the Christchurch mosque shootings. But Gamergate provided the traffic that 8chan needed to take off and grow. And it provided a series of values that meshed well with right-wing radicalization. If you believe women like Sarkeesian are ruining gaming, its easy to believe feminism is destroying Western culture. If you believe journalists of color in the gaming industry are being reverse racists toward white men, you could easily come to believe that Muslims are destroying white, European culture. Over time, shitposts about white nationalism turn into effort posts that lead to real-life violence against the most marginalized groups. All it takes is a userbase ready for indoctrination.","As far as Im concerned, this isnt the first chan shooter; this is just the most unambiguous, Olson told the Daily Dot. Gab, 4chan, 8chan, Reddits incel and redpill forums, Return of Kings, Kiwi Farmstheyre different sites, but its all the same pool of users. Its the same people.","","Over 82 million posts have been made on 8chan since it opened in October 2013, and the site is also among the top 5,000visited around the world. While the imageboard isnt quite as popular as 4chan8chans rival is among the top 900 sites internationallyits still one of the most popular imageboard alternatives, if not the most popular. Another popular alternate imageboard, lolcow.farm, has a global Alexa rating (ranking popularity) in the 25,000s. BBWChan, an imageboard dedicated to fetishism around large bodies, has a ranking in the 18,000s.","The sad reality is 8chan wasnt even founded on free speech: It was founded on pettiness. At least, thats what Twitter user Margaret Gel claims, who says she was friends with founder Brennan during Gamergate and tested features for 8chan at the time. She reached out to the Daily Dot and said his free speech rules were just a ploy to get as many users as possible to surpass 4chan, and that he hated most of the people who used his site.","When it came to Gamergate, he just thought that the people from Gamergate would help him with his ambitions of having a more popular site than 4chan, Gel alleged. He didnt even like them; they annoyed him, but he saw them as being a means to the end he wanted. (The Daily Dot reached out to Brennan for comment and is awaiting a response.)","Running a website is a great responsibility, one that should be taken seriously. That means moderating content appropriately and preventing dangerous materials from spreading, whether thats child pornography or hate speech. But 8chan was built on a foundation tied with some of the worst parts of the internet: pettiness, drama, and a right-leaning movement eager for legitimacy. Its no surprise 8chan ended up where it is today. It was set up for this.","Its exactly what I expected. Its exactly what you should expect when you let shit like this fester, and I really doubt that [Brennan] or [8chans current owner Jim Watkins] give a fuck that it happened, regardless of whatever theyre gonna say about it, @voidgndr told the Daily Dot. Anyone with their finger on the pulse in 2019, with any knowledge of the alt-rights origins, probably knew something like this was likely.","Update 7:45am CT, March 17:Brennan responded to the Daily Dots request for comment after the publication of this article. In a tweet from Saturday morning, he directed the Daily Dot to twopublic statements regarding his affiliation with 8chan. In particular, he stressed that while he founded 8chan, he is in no wise responsible for its continued operation, and that he has neither stake in nor any type of control over the website known as 8chan/8ch.net.","After being sent a list of questions responding to both Gels allegations and this published articles claims, Brennan stressed that he was not familiar with Gel and that he denies her account.","My only comment is that I had no idea who Gel was, Brennan told the Daily Dot over email. I looked up their ED page and Twitter and believe maybe Ive heard of them, I believe they were popular on Twitter during the Gamergate controversy, I recognize vaguely their Twitter handle, but of course deny being friends with them and deny their characterizations of myself and events generally.","Ana Valens","Ana Valens is an LGBTQ reporter and essayist for the Daily Dot.

It went on to gross $67.9 million domestically (adjusted). Ten years later, a television series spinoff also titled 10 Things I Hate About You aired on ABC Family.\n\nThe movie, which is a loose, modernized adaptation of Shakespeares The Taming of the Shrew, was a breakout for both Ledger and Stiles when they were just starting out in their acting careers. The cast also included Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larry Miller.","In honor of the film's anniversary, The Hollywood Reporter takes a look at what the cast has been up to in the two decades since the rom-com first hit theaters. (Warning: Some spoilers if you haven't seen the movie.)","In his first American film, Ledger scored his breakout role as Patrick Verona, the bad-boy heartthrob who is paid to pursue Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) in a scheme concocted by a sophomore (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) so that he is able to pursue a date with Kats younger sister, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). When he first rose to fame in 1999, he was labeled as a pretty boy actor with little potential for deeper roles. Hollywood was proved wrong when he took on more serious roles in The Patriot; Brokeback Mountain, which earned him an Oscar nom; and The Dark Knight, for which he won a posthumous Oscar for his portrayal of the DC Universe villain The Joker. Ledger died Jan. 22, 2008, due to cardiac arrest following an accidental overdose of prescription medications that included painkillers, anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills.","Stiles played the rebellious, hard-headed Kat Stratford, who was hesitant to accept the affection of Patrick Verona. She eventually ends up falling in love with Patrick after a roller-coaster series of events, with the film ending in her own rendition of a Shakespearean sonnet titled 10 Things I Hate About You. Stiles went on to be in Save the Last Dance, Mona Lisa Smile, The Prince and Me and the Matt Damon Bourne movies.","Before 10 Things I Hate About You, Joseph Gordon-Levitt had an extensive resume as far as his acting career, including roles in Roseanne and That '70s Show. In the movie, Gordon-Levitt plays Cameron, a newcomer sophomore who has eyes for Kats younger sister, Bianca (Oleynik). When he discovers that Biancas father refuses to let her date before her older sister, Kat, Cameron pays Patrick (Ledger) to ask Kat on a date. Gordon-Levitt went on to play more memorable roles in films such as (500) Days of Summer, Inception and The Dark Knight Rises.","Oleynik landed her role as Bianca Stratford after she was in The Babysitters Club and played a minor role in Boy Meets World. Bianca is the temperamental younger sister of Kat who just wants the chance to date senior Joey Donner, who previously dated Kat. As the story progresses, she inevitably realizes that Joey is just another sleazy teenage guy and eventually falls for Cameron (Gordon-Levitt). Oleynik continued her acting career and later starred in another production with Gordon-Levitt, the TV series 3rd Rock From the Sun. More recently, she recurred on Mad Men and made a guest appearance on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.","In 10 Things I Hate About You, Keegan plays the malicious Joey Donner. When he loses his romantic grip on Bianca, he reveals to Kat the schemes of Cameron and Patrick. Before portraying Donner, he appeared in popular '90s shows Full House, Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Boy Meets World and had recurring roles in the television series Party of Five and 7th Heaven. His more recent credits include mostly guest appearances on various TV series.","Gabrielle Union played Chastity in 10 Things I Hate About You in 1999, the year that marked her big-screen debut with not only this film but another teen rom-com, She's All That (released Jan. 29, 1999). Previously, she had a recurring role in the TV series Sister, Sister. Union went on to appear in other '90s movies and television shows, including 7th Heaven, and then went on to play Isis in the iconic cheerleading movie Bring It On, released in 2000. Union recently starred in the thriller Breaking In, where she portrayed a woman who must find a way to protect her family during a home invasion.","Comedian Larry Miller played Mr. Stratford, an obstetrician who just wants to protect his daughters from teenage boys. At first putting a restriction on their dating life until they graduate, he proposes the idea that Bianca (Oleynik) can date when Kat (Stiles) gets asked on one, knowing that this is unlikely due to Kats antisocial personality. Earlier in his career, he took on roles in The Princess Diaries, Max Keebles Big Move and My Wife and Kids.

Hes seen as a more progressive Representative from Californias 17th district, and he has really started to align himself with other more progressive Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.","Khanna, who has a seat on the House Oversight Committee with Ocasio-Cortez, is a strong backer of her Green New Deal which looks to implement the use of more green technology as a way to help drive America forward and stay ahead of the curve when it comes to future energy sources and environment precautions.","InEpisode 9 of KrassenCast, Khanna spoke about his support for the Green New Deal and helped explain why Republicans seem to be regressing rather than progressing. Episode 9 of KrassenCastis now available oniTunes,Youtube. andGoogle Play.","When asked why he thinks Republicans are so against the Green New Deal, Khanna said that it has a lot to do with the fact that President Trump campaigned on bringing us back to the past.","Trump said Im going to make America great again. Im going to take us back to some mythic golden age. I think its an easier bumper sticker to say Im going to take you back to a time that you remember as comfortable and easy and nostalgic, Khanna told KrassenCast. Its much harder to be for the future, which requires change and an openness to new ideas and new things.

And we had people oppose Lincoln, who wanted to do away with slavery. And then we had people oppose FDR and Dr. King Guy, Khanna explained to KrassenCast. Its always easy to score cheap political points by saying Im a defender of the status quo.","Some people embrace the status quo so much that they will elect an individual who promises to keep us there, regardless of that candidates other positive or negative qualifications for office.

In this post, Andy Tattersall draws on best practice from the sphere of viral marketing to develop the concept of Scholarly Enticement. He then presents a toolbox of simple techniques that can be applied by anyone across any discipline, to enhance the Scholarly Enticement of research.","Academia has a lot to learn from the outside world, especially the Web. The pressure on researchers to generate impact and attention have meant academics have tried to explore new and inventive ways of communicating their research. Many research papers fail to receive any attention at all and there may be a way to help them reach wider audiences outside of the academic domain. Given the success of email phishing and more recently clickbait websites, there may be some value in employing the former to disseminate outputs. Clickbait is a very negative term and has received a lot of bad publicity in recent years. My proposal is for the term scholarly enticement to be used as a way to lure curious readers to explore your latest research. The principles of clickbait can be applied to ensure research using this method has:","The research itself will remain untouched and not follow the principles of churnalism or yellow journalism. The aim of scholarly enticement is to get the reader to visit your works although there is no evidence they will stay there.","Social analytics company BuzzSumo analysed 100 million headlines to find out what the top headline phrases were. They produced a list of three word phrases or trigrams that gained the most Facebook likes, shares and comments. To help academics align their research with the principles of scholarly enticement, I have created a template of common clickbait trigrams from top headline phrases and applied them to generic research titles. You can mix and match your clickbait phrase with your own research.","The mix and match list approach","In addition to some of the suggestions above, you can employ the list method. This is especially useful for quantitative research and is ideal for creating scholarly enticement across multiple pages. You can use a mixture of trigrams from the list above and create a research paper that has a title like this:","Interdisciplinary case study: 23 reasons why the planet is getting hotter and you wont believe number 15.","If your intelligence and analytical gathering for impact includes metrics such as page hits consider breaking your research up across 20 separate web pages. Each page should have enough scholarly enticement to ensure the reader proceeds on to the next web page in the sequence. It is important that you leave your most important findings till the very last page, that way you maximise the number of clicks on your website. In some cases it is legitimate to leave out your conclusions, results and in extreme cases all text and just use images.","Images are instrumental as part of the scholarly enticement process so it is important you apply the right images to accompany your research. For anyone seeking inspiration for their research I suggest you use these suggestions for images in the corresponding research.","Research and clickbait have surprising similarities (see my list of 25 similarities and you wont believe number 18) which can help improve scholarly enticement. Research comes from curiosity to solve problems, that curiosity can be employed to draw attention from the outside. Research often explores human and emotional issues and clickbait titles are designed to play on our frailties, which in turn could gain you some valuable research impact. The truth is that for many of us we cant resist clicking on the link, knowing full well it is clickbait. If academics can harness the skills of scholarly enticement they will see greater engagement with their research, just make sure you dont link to the paywalled version of your work.","Note: This article is purely satire and clickbait should be treated with caution, furthermore the article gives neither the views of the author, the position of the LSE Impact Blog, nor of the London School of Economics.

Independent brokers fear the move could spur a wider industry trend, as carriers look to cut distribution costs. The move will not affect the firms 1.2 million current policyholders.","Genworths decision is the latest blow to the deeply-troubled industry. Sales of traditional policies have declined by more than 90 percent over the past decade and fewer than a dozen carriers still are selling the product. Most are organized as mutual, policyholder-owned companies. While Genworth still is publicly-held, it agreed in 2016 to be acquired by China Oceanwide Holdings Group. However, the deal has yet to be completed.","Combo products","These days, consumers mostly are buying so-called combo or hybrid policies that link long-term care coverage with annuities or life insurance. According to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, about 350,000 policies were purchased last year, but fewer than 60,000 were traditional, stand-alone policies. Another analyst, LIMRA, estimated that consumers purchased about 260,000 combo policies and about 60,000 stand-alone products in 2017.","Combo products come in many varieties, usually as riders to annuities or to whole or universal life insurance. With life policies, for instance, you may use a portion of your death benefit to pay for long-term care needs. Anything left over would go to your beneficiary.","While these products may be attractive to wealthier consumers, they are complicated and may come with added fees. Middle-income households with limited assets may be able to afford only partial coverage for their long-term care needs. But consumers often are attracted to a feature not available with traditional long-term care insurance: You receive benefits even if you have no long-term care needs.","At least in theory, stand-alone policies still make sense for many middle-market buyers. But high premiums have driven most consumers out of that market, even as uncertain risk has chased away nearly all carriers.","Reserves and rate hikes","In February, Genworth took an additional $327 million fourth-quarter pre-tax charge to boost the reserves it will need to pay future LTC insurance claims. It was just the latest in billions of dollars in reserves it has added in recent years. At the same time, the carrier is continuing its efforts to convince state insurance regulators to allow it to impose annual, small premium increases on policyholders, much like health insurance, rather than less frequent but much bigger premium hikes that are the standard for long-term care policies.","Last month, GE, which still has about 274,000 legacy long-term care policies it sold before spinning off the Genworth unit in 2003, announced it would request $1.7 billion in premium increases through 2029.","Hallway chatter","Last week, I attended the industrys annual conference in Chicago. Many programs focused on finding better ways to measure risk and others were about dementiathe single biggest uncertainty for both carriers and consumers. Roughly half of all long-term care insurance claims come from policyholders with Alzheimers and other dementias.","Other sessions discussed public options for long-term care coverage, such as pending legislation in Washington State to create a social insurance benefit of $36,500. Many insurance executives who had long criticized public programs such as Washingtons, now see it as an opportunity to rethink private insurance.","Company execs also were interested in the new Medicare Advantage benefits for supports and services. Last year, for the first time, Congress and the Trump Administration allowed plans to offer non-medical supplemental benefits such as personal care aides or home modifications.","While these benefits are modest and plan participation is low, this initiative could break down the long-standing barriers between medical care and social supports. And it has some long-term care insurance executives wondering: Could they create a policy that supplements limited long-term care-like benefits for the one-third of Medicare enrollees in managed care?","But much of the hallway chatter was about Genworth, and what seems to be an increasingly challenging future for traditional long-term care insurance.","I am a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center as well as an analyst on aging and retirement policy. I'm the author of the book \"Caring for Our Parents.\"","I am author of the book \"Caring for Our Parents\" and resident fellow at The Urban Institute, where I am affiliated with the Tax Policy Center and the Program on Retireme..."],"targetCaptions":[]}

And so began a days-long marathon of her sporting the part-plastered, part-rumpled look that artfully toed the line between her beloved I Dream of Jeannie updo (which also received a nod from hair pro Guido Palau at Versaces Pre-Fall 2019 show last December) and a revival of the polarizing crimped-hair look, which went in and out of fashion during the 80s, 90s, and early aughts.","Proving that its just as wearable during the daytime (and paired with a decidedly androgynous look), Kardashian West sported the style with an oversize Balenciaga mens trench coat to husband Kanye Wests music-slash-prayer session, Sunday Service, in Calabasas, California, the next day. Then, reworking the tieback into another half-up ponytailboasting even more crimped definition with help from hairstylist Justine Marjanshe sported the textured lengths with a slim white bodycon top and a high-waisted reptile-print skirt featuring a thigh slit for a dinner out with her sisters on Tuesday night. After appearing in her KKW Beauty Classic Blossom Collection campaign with brushed-out Pre-Raphaelite lengths last fall, taking on crimped hair was a natural next step for Kardashian West, especially with her retro-revival fever running high. But considering there was an army of fluffy, crimped manes at 3.1 Phillip Lim and Michael Kors during New York Fashion Week, and that Miu Miu and Louis Vuitton each served up buoyant clouds of rippled lengths as Paris Fashion Week drew to a close, its likely Kardashian West and her glam team were paying close attention to this seasons catwalks as well.","If youre planning to test-drive crimped hair, take a page from Kardashian Wests playbook: What makes this look so modern is that the front is sleek, explains Marjan. This gives a cool contrast to the texture.To create the look, Marjan prepped the hair with a veil of featherweight Tresemms Compressed Micro Mist hairspray, smoothed it half up tautly, then used GHDs Contour Professional Performance Crimper horizontally on panels of hair, pressing down gently and not for too long. Following the triumphant return of the scrunchie and a torrent of glitter-pressed gazes, consider crimped lengths next in line for beauty-loving, nostalgia-chasing millennials, with Kardashian West leading the charge.","Recommended For You","Part of CN Fashion & Beauty"," 2019  Cond Nast.

It brings this idea to life by urging its audience to \"imagine the world as a street ordered by income.\"","\"People from different continents, with the same income, are neighbors on Dollar Street,\" explains the site's co-creator, Anna Rosling Ronnlund, in a press release.","Created by Ronnlund (the co-author of one of Gates' favorite books \"Factfulness\") and the independent Swedish foundation Gapminder, the website documents over 264 homes in 50 countries, with photographers taking snap shots of daily life and objects, even things that seem trivial, like toothbrushes. Overall, the website says it has over 30,000 photos and 10,000 videos. It uses them to \"show how people on all different income levels meet their universal human needs,\" according to the release.","An interactive graphic at the top of the page features houses lined up on a street. By sliding the ticker at the top of the page to the left, you'll explore the lives of people toward the poorer end of the spectrum, while sliding to the right sends you toward the richer homes.","For example, on the poorest end of the street is a  family in India with a monthly income of $31. Photographs of the household show a makeshift structure created from tarps strung together, with a bed that's simply a tarp on the ground. Meanwhile, on the opposite end is an American family with a monthly income of $4,650. Their bed is large and decorated with a plethora of fluffy pillows.","While it's no surprise that the people living in poverty in India lead very different lives than the affluent crowd in the U.S., the site points out most people live somewhere between \"poor\" and \"rich.\"","And when you compare household objects (another filter along with income and location), it becomes clear there are many similarities among people of the same income level, even when they live in different countries.","\"I found the photos of toothbrushes to be particularly interesting,\" Gates writes in his blog post. \"The families at the poorest end of the street use their fingers or sticks to clean their teeth. But once you reach a certain income level, everyone starts using a plastic toothbrush with bristles.\"","Adds Gates, \"People tend to spend money on the same things once they increase their income whether they live in China or Cameroon.\"","Gates is well-known for his philanthropic efforts and for taking an interest in the way other people live. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation tackles a number of projects aimed at lifting others out of poverty, by providing economic mobility and opportunity, and past blog posts penned by Gates focus on topics like inequality. In his blog post touting Dollar Street, Gates writes that whenever he visits a new location, he looks for clues indicating the income level of locals.","\"If I see power lines, I know homes probably have electricity in this area  which means that kids have enough light to do their homework after the sun sets,\" Gates writes. \"If I see patchwork roofs, families likely sleep less during the rainy season because they're wet and cold. If I see bikes, that tells me people don't have to spend hours walking to get water every day.\"","But for Gates, Dollar Street is a great illustration of what brings people together.","\"At the end of the day, we all want a solid roof over our head, a more efficient way to get around, and better tools to take care of ourselves,\" Gates writes. \"It's a beautiful reminder that we have more in common with people on the other side of the world than we think.\"","Don't miss: Bill Gates is paying off this country's $76 million debt","Like this story?

Pressing a button and inhaling (or sometimes simply inhaling) heats the liquid, creating an aerosol that can be inhaled the same way tobacco smoke from a regular cigarette is inhaled.","Juuls were introduced to American consumers in 2015, well after other brands of electronic cigarettes. But Juuls quickly became very popular, due to their small size; the cartridges are not much bigger than a typical USB flash drive. Their compact size makes concealing the devices easier, and thisalong with bubblegum-like flavorsmay help explain why Juuls and vaping (another name for smoking e-cigarettes) have become so popular with kids.","You may have seen marketing claims that Juuls are safer than cigarettes, but health experts arent so sure. Indeed, research suggests that e-cigarettes can be potentially toxic and dangerous foryour lungs.","The liquid contains toxic substances","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","Cigarettes are much maligned because of the thousands of chemicals in each puff. E-cigarettes may not have as high a number of ingredients, but they do contain chemicals that are not considered safe and nontoxic. Vaping contains nicotine but also propylene glycol, flavored chemicals, glycerin, and byproducts including formaldehyde, which is toxic to the lungs, says Janette Nesheiwat, MD, family and emergency physician.","Each puff from a Juul pod releases a nicotine dose similar to a traditional cigaretteand at least 70 chemicalsbut the concentration arrives at the nicotine receptors in your body up to 2.7 times faster than with other electronic cigarettes. Indeed, smoking a Juul could be as dangerous as smoking a pack a day for teenagers.","The risks grow the longer you vape","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","A study in the journal Oral Oncology linked e-cigarettes to cancer-related cell damage. With each puff, youre inhaling two primary e-cigarette ingredientspropylene glycol and vegetable glycerinwhich contain a high level of toxins. Whats more, toxicity from these ingredients increases the more you vape. And thats not the only riskcheck out 8 silent ways e-cigarettes harm your body.","Heating releases potentially toxic chemicals","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","Although e-cigarettes are noncombustible, the heating process does release chemicals such as formaldehyde, which are known carcinogens, says Amy M. Ahasic, MD, MPH, section chief, pulmonary and critical care medicine at Norwalk Hospital, WCHN.","While the individual components of e-liquidspropylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavoring, nicotineare safe and approved for consumption, when they are heated, as they are with the Juul device, they create carbonylsacrolein and formaldehydeas well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), Dr. Nesheiwat says. All of these can cause irritation and even irreversible lung damage. Acrolein, when inhaled, has been linked to lung cancer. PAHs are carcinogenic as well.","Juuls irritate and inflame the lungs","MaryCaroline/Shutterstock","[Some Juul] ingredients are known to cause irritation and inflammation in the lungs; prolonged exposure can result in damage to the DNA of the cells, which then results in cancer after prolonged exposure, Dr. Nesheiwat says. It can also cause whats called wet lung, Wet lung is basically irritation in the lung that inflames the tissue and mimics pneumonia. It can be life-threatening as well and results in sudden life-threatening respiratory distress.","Flavorings contain known toxic substances","MaryCaroline/Shutterstock","Juul pods come in eight flavors, with options like mango, mint, and cucumber. Many e-cigarette flavors often contain diacetyl, a chemical that has been shown to irritate and damage airways. The chemical is often used to create buttery flavorsits the ingredient in microwave popcorn that makes it one of the 12 foods you think are healthy but are notand is a reasonmicrowave popcorn is a food that cancer docs wont eat. Research has shown that workers at factories producing the chemical have developed a specific type of lung diseasereferred to as popcorn workers lung. Indeed, diacetyl vapors are considered a workplace hazard.","The flavors themselves are chemicals that are known to cause chronic lung disease, says Dr. Ahasic, who is also the chair of the occupational and environmental health network of the American College of Chest Physicians. While we havent really seen that with e-cigarettes yet, its the same chemical. The type of lung disease that we see with flavorings-related lung disease is quite serious. In some cases, it can be lethal.","Juuls may not help you stop smoking","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","E-cigarettes in general, and Juuls in particular, are marketed as a safer alternative to cigarettes and a tool to help people give up tobacco products. However, research has not found them to be a safer alternative, or particularly helpful in getting people to quit.","When people are trying to break the habit and then they are using something that looks and feels similar to a cigarette and are inhaling similar to a cigarette, they are really enforcing the smoking behavior, Dr. Ahasic says. That can make it not a very good smoking cessation tool.","Heat can damage airways","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","The heat itself can be an irritant, Dr. Ahasic says. It can cause inflammation of the airways That can cause cough and mucus and shortness of breath in some people. There can be pretty immediate effects on the airways from the irritant factors of all the fine particulate matter youre inhalingand thats true of e-cigarettes, aerosols, as well as traditional cigarettes.","Irritation overtime can lead to inflammation, which may be a risk factor for lung diseases, including lung cancer. Thinking e-cigarettes are a such a healthy alternative to cigarettes is one of the 50 health mistakes people make every day.","Juuls may cause secondhand smoke damage","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","Were all aware of some of the dangers of secondhand smoke; unfortunately, no one considers the dangers of secondhand e-smoke. There is less in an e-cigarettes aerosol thats bad, but its still there, Dr. Ahasic says. When its in a lower concentration, how much longer might it take for us to see the effects because the intensity of the exposure may be less?","We simply dont know enough yet","Steve Heap/Shutterstock","The problem is we really dont have any long-term health data, Dr. Ahasic says. E-cigarettes have been on the market for less than 15 years, she points out. If we think about lung cancer, the majority of patients diagnosed with lung cancer are aged 65 or greater, and many of those people started smoking when they were in their teens and 20s.","In 2016, the U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek H. Murthy, MD, MBA, released a report on the use of e-cigarettes among youth and young adults, warning: Although e-cigarettes generally emit fewer toxicants than combustible tobacco products, we know that aerosol from e-cigarettes is not harmless.

I live in Los Angeles and recently, I've been seeing a ton of advertisements for something called Vital Proteins collagen. I'm talking billboards, ads, and endcap displays at Target. So, obviously I had to look up what it was!","When I visited their website, I learned that our body slows the production of collagen as we age, so Vital Proteins collagen powder helps promote the production of collagen through their products. The benefits can include hair growth, nail growth, joint health, and digestion. So I decided to try it out for a month and see what I thought.","The first flavor of collagen powder I tried was lavender lemon. I used this when drinking chamomile tea because I honestly wasn't sure what else it would mix well with, but it does taste good with the tea.","The next flavor I tried was matcha. I've always thought matcha was just OK, but there was a matcha latte recipe on the Vital Proteins website that I decided to try to see if my mind would change.","The final result? The recipe did make a beautiful latte, but I JUST wasn't into it. It's not you, matcha collagen latte  it's ME. I am just not a matcha girl. But if you are, then I'm sure you'll find this extremely tasty.","You also don't have to ONLY mix this with liquid. There are plenty of recipes that include some scoops of collagen  like these MATCHA COOKIES recipe.","Get this recipe here.","Then there's the unflavored collagen peptides powder. Because I'm boring, I also mixed this with hot drinks (like coffee). But your cooking options are pretty much endless with this stuff, like this nacho appetizer.","Get the recipe here.","Or if you're wanting something healthier, you can use the unflavored collagen in this turkey burger recipe.","Get this recipe here.","The product I was most excited about was actually the biggest disappointment. The collagen creamer is very thick and very clumpy/sticky. No matter how long I stirred it into my coffee, it would not dissolve fully. There were times I'd been drinking and swallow a tiny clump of collagen powder. YOU BET I GAGGED.","But instead of tossing it, I figured it would be better if you used it for cooking. Because it doesn't necessarily have to dissolve into a liquid  it just needs to be mixed. Like with these lemon cashew balls.","Get the recipe here.","My favorite collagen to use in my morning cup of coffee ended up being the flavorless Marine Collagen. I put two scoops (as directed) into my cup every morning and it blended so smoothly. It even left it a little bit frothy after I stirred. After adding my usual creamer in, it tasted great! No weird flavors or textures.","After about a month, my nails were lookin' GOOOOOD. I was surprised my gel manicure lasted this long  but anyway you can see a huge difference in length. I'm someone who has nails that constantly break/don't grow very long, so this proved SOMETHING was working.","After using Vital Proteins collagen over 60 days, I did see a difference in my hair length as well. It's longer for sure, but my co-worker who took the after picture also noticed how shiny it was.","Overall, I did see a big difference in my nails and a slight difference in my hair. I'm going to continue using the unflavored collagen as well as the lavender lemon (because it was my fave) in the future  and it's so easy to add into a quick cup of coffee or tea.","Find more Vital Proteins recipe here.","Products were provided to BuzzFeed by Vital Proteins.","Top trending videos","Facebook comments","Advertisement","Connect With\n      \n        \n  BuzzFeed\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n      \n      \n        Culture","BuzzFeed HomeSitemap 2019 BuzzFeed, Inc."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Shortly after this, dozens, and soon hundreds, will follow. Space enthusiasts have made such promises about space tourism for nearly a decade, but in 2019 it's finally coming true.","In the last three months, Virgin Galactic has completed two crewed test flights above 80km. And with its flight-tested New Shepard launch system, Blue Origin remains on track to blast its own people into space later this year. Both spacecraft can carry up to six passengers. Neither company has begun commercial operations, but these flights appear imminent. Later this year, suborbital space tourism should finally transition from long-promised to something you can do if you're rich enough. Next year, we will likely see dozens of commercial flights.","Further Reading","These welcome successes have raised a question, however: just what do we call thesepeople?","Until now, it has been fairly easy to call men and women who have gone to space astronauts (or cosmonauts in Russia, and taikonauts in China). About 560 humans have gone to space, nearly all of them into orbit, and a lucky two dozen have gone beyond. Twelve have walked on the Moon.","In 2004, the private SpaceShipOne venture clouded the picture a little bit by making a private suborbital flight. The pilots, Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, had not trained as government astronauts, so the US Federal Aviation Administration created a new designation for themcommercial astronauts. Since then, the five crew members of Virgin Galactic's VSS Unity flights in December and February have also earned that designation. But the FAA will only recognize \"crew,\" not passengers.","For now, there remains no official word on what to call non-crew members. Are they astronauts, too? Space passengers? Astro-nots? In the hopes of finding a consensus, we put that precise question to the companies, some bonafide NASA astronauts, and some experts in the aerospace community.","Defining space","This is not a story about the definition of space. For a long time, the generally accepted boundary of space was 100km, the so-called the Krmn line. This artificial barrier is recognized by the Fdration Aronautique Internationale, the international record-keeping organization for aerospace. But this view is not unanimous, as the US Air Force delineated 80km as \"space\" for its participants in the X-15 rocket plane program.","For Virgin Galactic, this is a salient issue, because its tourist flights are likely to reach a peak altitude above 80km, but below 100km. In all of its promotional materials, the company has referred to anything above 80km as space. HarvardUniversity astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, has argued that orbiting objects can survive multiple perigees at altitudes around 80 to 90km and that this altitude range is consistent with the highest physical boundary of the atmosphere, the mesopause. An altitude of 80km, McDowell says, is consistent with the lower boundary of space.","Further Reading","Virgin's primary competitor in suborbital space tourism, Blue Origin, sees its guarantee of a flight above 100km as a valuable marketing point. The company will fly that high, founder Jeff Bezos said, because it does not want there to be any \"asterisks\" next to its customers' names when it comes to astronaut designation.","\"One of the issues that Virgin Galactic will have to address, eventually, is that they are not flying above the Krmn line,\" Bezos said ata Wings Club luncheon in February. \"The vehicle isn't quite capable. So for most of the world, the edge of space is defined as 100 kilometers. In the US, it's different. But I think that one of the things that they will have to figure out is how to get above the Krmn line.\"","The purpose of this story is not to litigate the boundary of space, however. Rather, it is to discuss what to call people who buy tickets on suborbital vehicles. They're not trained astronauts. (Many of NASA's best and brightest recruits train for five years, or more, before launching). They're not crew. Mostly, they simply had the disposable funds to buy a ticket, a free weekend, and the fortitude to strap themselves to a rocket.","The marketers","Not surprisingly, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin both believe people who buy their tickets$250,000 for Virgin, and an as-yet undisclosed amount for Blueshould justifiably call themselves astronauts. We asked each company for its rationale why.","Here was Virgin Galactic's response:","As you know, at Virgin Galactic our customers pre-flight are Future Astronauts and post-flight they will be Astronauts.","Why? Because throughout history, any human who has flown above a certain altitude, regardless of whether it's orbital or sub-orbital, [has] been called astronautsor cosmonauts or taikonauts. Nonetheless, as a proud US and European brand, we're delighted to stick with astronaut and follow the tradition set.","And here is what we received from Blue Origin:","Those who fly with Blue Origin will be called astronauts. Theyll be trained for spaceflight and will travel above the Krmn line, the internationally recognized boundary of space, joining the rank of other astronauts who have done the same.","There are few surprises in these responses, so now let us turn to some other stakeholders in the aerospace community.","reader comments","Share this story","You must login or create an account to comment.","Channel Ars Technica","Related Stories","Sponsored Stories","Today on Ars","Newsletter Signup","Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.","CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n   2019 Cond Nast.

Should things get real ugly, and Huawei is banned from using Googles Android OS on its smartphones or Windows on its computers, the company already has backup operating systems in place.","Speaking to Die Welt, Huawei executive Richard Yu says, We have prepared our own operating system, if it turns out we can no longer use these systems, we will be ready and have our plan B.","According to reports all the way from 2012, Huawei began working on backup systems when the US opened an investigation into both Huawei and ZTE.","In the US, Huawei would have zero chance without the Android OS. However, in other markets, it may not be the end of the world for its smartphone business. After all, they do make their own smartphone processors. For PCs, though, Huawei uses Intel silicon, and if a ban were to take place, similar to how it did for ZTE, Huawei would need to look elsewhere for its laptop-grade processors. Either way, any type of ban is bad for business.","Our hope is that this wont ever happen. While it sucks not really having Huawei as an option in the US, itd be even worse if the company was forced off of Android altogether.","// The Verge | Die Welt","Category","Tags","Need a Free Wear OS Watch Face?

They run a giant liquor distributorship in California and a new distillery on the Bourbon Trail in Bardstown, Kentucky.","But they had a problem: Their son didn't seem to have the grades or test scores to earn admission to a top university.","Like his father, Lou Palatella, a renowned offensive lineman and linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s, the son played football. But he had quit his high school team after realizing he was too small to play at the major collegiatelevel.","So what is a loving parent to do?","What Marci Palatella did, according to a 204-page federal indictment returned last week,  was to pay $575,000 to buy her sons way into the private and extremely selective University of Southern California.","Palatella, 63, was one of 33 affluent parents across the country, including Hollywood actresses and CEOs, charged in the nations largest college admissions scam.In all, 50 people were arrested and nine coaches implicated at schools such as Yale, Georgetown and USC.","Palatella's husband and son were not charged nor named in the indictment.","But the charging document says Palatella wired $75,000 to a bogus foundation to pay for a proctor to doctor her son's SAT college-entrance exam. With the proctor's help, Palatellas son scored 1410 out of 1600 on the test.","According to the College Board, the average SAT score in 2018 was 1068.","March 14: 2 Stanford students file first class-action suit in largest-ever college admissions scandal","March 14: A Yale soccer coach caught in a sting: How the FBI broke open the sweeping college admission scandal","Then, the indictment alleges, Palatella mailed a $100,000 check to a senior associate athletic director at USC. That director presented a profile to the university's subcommittee for athletic admissions that falsely described Palatella's son as a defensive lineman and long snapper on his high school football team and as a member of several \"local and statewide championship teams between 2015 and 2017.\"","Finally, after USC formally accepted her son, Palatella allegedly wired $400,000 to the foundation operated by the mastermind behind the scheme, William Rick Singer, whothe government says collected $25 million from parents over eight years to bribe coaches and administrators.","Scam mastermind cooperates with authorities","Unbeknownst to Palatella, Singer, who ran a college-prep company and the nonprofit Key Worldwide Foundation, had been charged last year and was secretly cooperating with investigators.","He pleaded guilty Tuesday in Boston to racketeering conspiracy, money laundering and obstruction of justice.","The USC administrator, Donna Heinel, also has been charged with racketeering, as has former USC assistant soccer coach Laura Janke, whothe indictment states fabricated athletic profiles for Palatella's son and other students.","According to court papers, Palatella not only benefited by getting her son into USC, she also deducted her payments to the foundation as charitable donations on her tax returns.","March 14: College admissions scandal: Why we won't see mug shots for Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman","March 14: What we know about Olivia Jade, Lori Loughlin's daughter caught up in admissions scandal","Palatella did not respond to messages left at her distillery in Bardstown or at International Beverage, the Burlingame, California, company for which she is CEO. Her San Francisco attorney, Camilo Artiga-Purcell, also did not immediately respond to a call and an email.","Palatella made an initial court appearance Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco and was released on a $1 million unsecured bond, meaning she didn't have to post any money.","Couple praised for contributions to Bardstown","Bardstown Mayor Dick Heaton said Palatella and her husband have been \"great corporate and community citizens\" since they opened the distillery in 2016. They also bought a home in Bardstown, he said.","\"We in Bardstown have had a great experience with Marci and Lou, he said. We feel blessed that they have chosen Bardstown.","The couple have been coming to Kentucky for years for their liquor business and had joined the Kentucky Distillers' Association last year, said its president, Eric Gregory.","\"We are not going to comment on this situation right now,\" he said.","The indictment says Palatella participated in both prongs of the scam  cheating on entrance examsand bribing college coaches and administrators to win favored admissions status for athletes.","In her case, that included an alleged bribe to Heinel, the senior associate athletic directorwhom USC has fired.","As with other parents, Palatella, at Singer's direction, first arranged for her son to be evaluated by a psychologist so he could qualify to get extended time to complete his SAT.","A contribution for admission","In September 2016, after receiving the psychologist's report, she asked Singer whether her son should apply for extended time on the ACT exam as well.","\"Do both that way, if one says no we have the other, he replied.","Singer arranged for the boy to take the exam at a testing center in West Hollywood, where the proctor could cheat for him, according to the indictment.","March 14: Surprising no one: What Lori Loughlin and Michael Jackson uproar teaches us about denial","March 13: The 'really smart guy' who aced SATs for rich students: 'I will always regret' the scandal","Palatella toldher son's high schoolin Atherton, California, near San Francisco, that he was taking the test in Los Angeles because the family was taking him there for the weekend \"to look at schools.\" She also said his outside college adviser recommended he take his test at that facility.","On March 7, 2017, she allegedly wired the $75,000 to one of the foundation's charitable accounts.","She also asked Singer, identified in court papers asCW-1 (cooperating witness 1), what else she could do to \"position\" her son for admission.","\"Are you willing to make a contribution of several hundred thousand as a donation to get him in as a participant in someone's program?\" he asked, according to a court-approved wiretap.","\"Money, for the right environment, yes,\" Palatella allegedly said. \"But he can never know.\"","Singer then gave her a price list, which he described as \"the number it would take to get admitted, even with the fudging\" of his SAT score.","It might take more than $1 million to bribe a students way into Georgetown or Boston College, he said.","Scammer says son's admission is 'covered'","In an email in October2016, Palatella asked Singer whether certain schools would be \"realistic\" for her son, given his B average, the indictment states.","He answered that the only way in would be through athletics because colleges give leeway to athletes. And he said football was the best bet because that is the sport with the lowest grades.","When she asked whether her son should return to his high school team, he said not to bother:\"I got it covered ... no worries on the story for your son.\"","Palatella responded with four heart emojis, according to the indictment.","March 13: Lori Loughlin released on $1 million bond in bribery scandal, can fly to Canada for work","March 13: 'Affirmative action for the rich:' How the privileged legally game the college admissions process","After she sent him a photo of her son in his football uniform, Singer forwarded it to Janke, who created a \"football profile\" for him that falsely described him as an active player on his high school team, according to the indictment.","Heinel then allegedly presented it to the admission committee in November 2017, falsely describing him as a \"long snapper.\"","She later allegedly sent a conditional acceptance letter to the boy saying he had \"potential to make a significant contribution to the intercollegiate athletic program as well as to the academic life of the university.\"","Palatella the next day sent a $100,000 check to Heinel, payable to the USC Women's Athletic Board, adding that \"our son is beyond thrilled at the prospect of attending USC as a freshman this fall.\"","Six days after he got his formal acceptance letter the following spring, Palatella on April 1, 2018, allegedly wired $400,000 to the foundation.","Last October, at the direction of law enforcement, Singer called Palatella and told her that the IRS was auditing the foundation and that they needed to get their stories straight.","He said that if she were contacted, she should say her contributions were to \"help underserved kids,\"and she agreed to do so, according to the indictment.","The scam was 'worth every cent'","No students have been charged, and the indictment says most of them didnt know their parents had schemed to get them into college.","But Palatella in January allegedly told Singer that she had received a \"disturbing call\" from a neighbor whom she had told in confidence that she had paid $200,000 to secure her son's admission to USC. (In fact, the indictment notes, she had paid more than twice that amount.)","Palatella allegedly told Singer that she and her spouse \"laugh every day\" about how grateful they were for his services, and that \"people at Goldman Sachs,\" the investment bank, had recommended him highly.","\"It was worth every cent,\" she said, according to the indictment.","Contributing: Billy Kobin, (Louisville, Ky.)

The decision was made after Murdochs channel refused to stop showing graphic video footage shot by the man who killed 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday.","This was despite calls from the police urging anyone broadcasting the disturbing footage to stop circulating it. Police are aware there is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online, the New Zealand police said in a statement. We would strongly urge that the link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.","On Saturday, the New Zealand broadcaster announced the decision to pull the channel off the air. We stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and have made the decision to remove Sky News Australia from our platform until we are confident that the distressing footage from yesterdays events will not be shared, it said in a now-deleted Tweet.","Soon after in a new Tweet, the broadcaster changed its message saying, We stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and are working with our colleagues at @SkyNewsAust to ensure coverage doesnt compromise ongoing investigations in NZ. We made the decision on Friday with Sky News Australia to replace their live news with sport.","In a statement Friday, a Sky News Australia spokesman said: Sky News in line with other broadcasters ran heavily edited footage that did not show the shootings or the victims.","Sky News Australia didnt air in New Zealand for five days, returning on Wednesday, March 20, according to Sky New Zealand. In the interim, the networks worked to change the perception created by Sky New Zealand that Sky News Australia had been forced off the air. Sky New Zealand emailed ThinkProgress on March 21, saying that it would like to take the opportunity to correct statements made by us on Saturday.","Sky New Zealand spokesperson Chris Major said in a statement that the networks decided together to pull the coverage shortly after the attacks. It was a proactive and precautionary decision taken by both parties to ensure any live coverage or commentary taking place in Australia, outside of the NZ jurisdiction, did not compromise the NZ investigations and legal process, the statement said.","Fridays mass shooting was streamed to Facebook live video by the shooter for at least 17 minutes. YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter have since been working to remove footage of the massacre, however, new copies of the video continue to be uploaded.","Officials in the U.K. have also called on the tech companies to stop the spread of this footage. Online platforms have a responsibility not to do the terrorists work for them, British Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote in an article for The Daily Expresson Saturday.","The alleged shooter was a self-described terrorist who wrote a manifesto about white supremacy, in which he praised President Donald Trump, calling the president a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose. The manifesto also included mention of conservative pundits and other white supremacist killers.","But when asked whether he thought white supremacy was a growing danger around the world, Trump said he did not.","Meanwhile, Murdochs Fox News channel in the U.S. has aired several segments in which it positions conservatives as the victims, fearing the Friday massacre is being used as an attempt to limit their free speech.","Already tonight, you are hearing calls in this country for curbs on free speech in response to the New Zealand massacre, Fox host Tucker Carlson said Friday night. Jeff Bezos newspaper wasted no time in blaming the entire thing [on] free flow of ideas that are, quote, spreading hate. For the censorship class, more control is always the solution. Ban more people, squelch more ideas, go deplatform someone.","Meanwhile, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh promoted the theory that the whole event may be a false-flag perpetrated by someone on the left in order to blame conservatives.","CORRECTION: This article previously stated that Limbaugh was a radio host for Fox News.

This is based on our two new News Reporters producing 15-25 short 400-500-word news articles each month.","Leaked spreadsheets seen by BuzzFeed News that lay out Evolve Politics finances reveal just how little money goes to writers on top of the 10 standard fee under its pay-per-click model.","The spreadsheets show Evolve paid 18 in digital ad revenue to one journalist who wrote a story that got 6,700 pageviews. Another whose story got 11,300 views received 23. They also state the site has an annual turnover of 24,000, and makes a stated 19,000 profit  but according to Rogers, most of this is paid to him and Miller as wages.","For stories with lower traffic, its even more stark. A journalist whose story got 1,300 views was paid 11 of digital ad revenue on top of their 10 fee.","The January spreadsheet also reveals that Rogers  who wrote 31 stories that month, averaging 8,800 views per story  was paid 90% of the websites monthly digital ad revenue of 734. It's the amount calculated under the same formula used to pay other writers.","In the run-up to the 2017 general election, Evolve Politics and others such as the Canary, Skwawkbox, and Another Angry Voice were pumping out pro-Corbyn viral news articles that often reached many more people than stories from established news outlets. A BuzzFeed News analysis at the time showed Evolve Politics stories were averaging more than 7,500 shares on Facebook per article in the first week of the election.","Months later, Evolve Politics joined other pro-Corbyn websites in signing up to the new press regulator Impress.","Its success even led to the site becoming the first of the stable to get a prized Lobby pass, giving its then-editor Matt Turner access to Downing Street press briefings and the backrooms of Parliament.","Turner later became a media adviser to MP Fiona Onasanya  the parliamentarian who was expelled from Labour after being convicted for lying over a speeding offence. He told BuzzFeed News he had recently quit Onasanya's office.","But then came Facebooks changes to the News Feed in 2018, which saw referral traffic to news websites crash across the media. Digital news websites which had previously benefitted from huge amount of Facebook traffic, including BuzzFeed News, contracted.","To try to soften the blow, Evolve Politics and nine other websites pivoted to Facebook groups, with the creation of Independent Media UK  a group which would make sure die-hard pro-Corbyn fans could be reached with each websites news stories.","In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Rogers said the website was \"more than happy to be transparent about all aspects of our operation\".","\"Myself and Jess are a couple, and like most other human beings living under our current extremely unfair socioeconomic system, we require money to remain alive (as we currently wish to be),\" Rogers said. \"Therefore, we now take a flat rate of 700 each to live on each month.","\"This does not increase of decrease based on how much we write, or how successful our articles are, and this is the bare minimum we need to pay our bills.\"","He added that the 19,000 labelled \"profit\" on the spreadsheet actually included the amount the couple paid themselves in wages.","\"Previously, whilst we were building Evolve up, we lived off of our savings for over a year in order to grow the site. Unfortunately, this basic wage  which is now entirely necessary in order for us to pay our rent and eat  now constitutes the vast majority of Evolve's monthly income, and due to our depleted personal savings, we have had to make decisions that reflect this.","\"We are more than happy for you to report any and all details of our financial status. However, your theory that we made 19,000 profit is not true  the majority of that will consist of wages (16,800 from March to February) for myself and Jess to afford to live.\"","In the message seen by BuzzFeed News, Rogers wrote: Myself and Jess currently take a salary of 700 each a month to live on, and also feel the best way to build Evolve sustainably is by setting a baseline standard fee for all articles so we dont have to be so picky about what stories we run.","We have not taken this decision lightly, but our subscriber base has essentially plateaued over the last few months, meaning we have a stable 800 coming in from paid subscribers each month  plus a particularly inconsistent amount of ad revenue  meaning we need to ensure consistent growth whilst ensuring we have enough to pay our bills.","Evolve Politics is not the first in the network of left-wing websites with this type of payment model. According to a disclaimer on its website, the Canary continues to pay journalists on a per-click basis.","Heather Brooke","Heather Brooke, professor of journalism at City University, said Evolve Politics' payment of contributors showed the shortsightedness of paying journalists and freelancers according to clicks.","\"Unfortunately, too many news organisations are run by people who have little love or respect for journalism, and even less understanding about its vital role in ensuring a healthy democracy,\" Brooke told BuzzFeed News.","\"Quality news takes time and skill. Facts must be verified. Rumours checked out. A professional journalist needs time to build up quality sources and institutional knowledge, then they turn all that knowledge into compelling copy that breaks down complex issues into digestible and meaningful stories. No professional can do that on 21 per article.","\"A business model that incentivizes clicks will inevitably lead to content focused on grabbing attention by whatever means necessary. Thats not been to the benefit of readers or society.\"","One Evolve Politics contributor, who asked not to be named, told BuzzFeed News the website was hypocritical for the way it attacked the mainstream media, while paying freelancers so little.","I find it odious that they attack mainstream outlets for their pay structure but, can't even apply the National Union of Journalists minimum fees for freelancers themselves, the contributor said.","This isn't about independent versus mainstream, it's about paying a fair wage to those who provide them with materials,\" the contributor said.It's frankly hypocritical.","Mark Di Stefano is a media and politics correspondent for BuzzFeed News and is based in London.","Contact Mark Di Stefano at mark.distefano@buzzfeed.com.","Got a confidential tip?

These former investigators have worked on some of the biggest federal cases in recent history. Their experiences span three-plus decades, giving them a unique perspective on what might happen next.","Meet the crew of experts who answered your most pressing questions on Reddit:","Weve reproduced some of the top Q&As below, edited slightly for brevity and clarity.","Advertisement","Question","Are you surprised?"," asked on Reddit by Shaokim","Samborn:","Yes, on two points.","I did not expect that Mueller would punt the question of obstruction to Congress, although I understand it makes sense if we assume that he was never going to make a decision to indict the president.","I think Attorney General Barr inserted a plot twist yesterday by superimposing his own judgment about obstruction in the absence of any special counsel regulation or authority calling for him to make that judgment.","Barrett:","With regard to Muellers bottom lines, not really. It makes sense that Mueller, who is an underling, not the boss of DOJ, would make the prosecution declination decision when he found insufficient evidence that Trump or any other U.S. person conspired with Russia to affect the 2016 election  declinations are what underling prosecutors do.","It also makes sense that on the other question  did the president endeavor to obstruct justice?  where the evidence and legal questions were closer and complicated, Mueller sent it all upstairs to his bosses Barr and Rosenstein for them to decide.","Myers Wood:","I am a little surprised that Mueller did not make a decision regarding a prosecution or declination decision regarding the potential obstruction of justice given that Mueller was likely in the best position to know the underlying facts and the relevant regulations. Mueller, of course, could have determined that such a decision was inappropriate given the guidance on whether a president could be indicted, but Barrs summary does not make this clear.","Question","Could Trump and his family have indictments slapped on them from the many other investigations still going on?"," asked on Reddit by ExoticWear","Samuelsohn:","We got this question a bunch this weekend, so I'll take a stab at it here. Short answer, sure, it's possible Trump and his family could still face indictments down the line from the other investigations.","We know SDNY is looking into the Trump campaign finance spending out of the Michael Cohen case, as well as the inauguration committee. I'll point you to a storyI wrote back in February (feels like years ago) quoting some former SDNY types saying they wouldn't rule out indictments against the president, especially given he is \"Individual 1\" in the Cohen case.","And while I'm touting all of my work from the last two years, here's a storyI wrote that I think still very much applies that Trump's 2020 reelection won't just be about him winning a second term, it also could be a trigger point for him to face indictments he can't otherwise face while he's in office.","Lastly, don't forget as well the NY AG is also looking into the president's business enterprise","Question","When will the Mueller report be made public?"," asked on Reddit by TheGoldenHeaven","Samuelsohn:","Great question. If I knew the answer I would be rich.","Seriously, though, we are now in a waiting period  one that Id say will take months, not weeks  while Attorney General William Barr and his aides go through the weeds of the report looking to remove classified and grand jury information that is not allowed to be made public.","In his letter yesterday, Barr said hed be consulting with Mueller to help find all that information as quickly as possible. He also said he needs to be cognizant of other ongoing matters like open investigations, so that will slow things down a bit, since he doesnt want to release a report that undermines potential prosecutions.","Barr reads the papers and knows theres lots of clamor for this document. So hell be under pressure  especially from Democrats  to get something more out.","Update","The day after our chat, a DOJ official said that Barrs review would take weeks not months. So that could mean around mid-April is when we go through this whole routine again without maybe as much of the anticipation.","Myers Wood:","I generally agree with Darren, but think that the pressure from Congress to receive the full report is going to be substantial and Congress is not going to want to wait weeks or months.","One possibility is that DOJ could file a request with the Courtto have all (or some) of the grand jury information in Mueller's report made available to the Congress so that the full report could be sent to Congress for their consideration. This is what happened for the Starr report. If the full report is sent to the Hill, Congress could release (or leak) the report very quickly.","Barrett:","I agree with Darren  this will take a lot of consulting, including with intelligence agencies, so it will take at least weeks, I think.","Question","Are you satisfied with Barr's summary? Or do you think it's suspect and that the full report needs to be released?"," asked on Reddit by YeahSureYnot","Barrett:","Middle ground. I don't think one can really assess Barr's summary without seeing Mueller's report. But I don't think there is a basis to suspect Barr or Mueller of anything nefarious  they are people of integrity.","Samborn:","I basically agree with John, although I believe it's critical to see Mueller's report.","I also think that Barr should be more transparent about why he decided to provide his and others assessment of the obstruction evidence and what his reasons were for doing so. It's not clear that Mueller invited Barr's evaluation of the evidence or if he intended for Congress to grapple with the issue.","Absent greater explanation from Barr, critics could claim that the president found a loyal protector to be his attorney general, undermining confidence in the process.","Question","To what extent does the fact that Trump was not interviewed by Mueller and his team impact the credibility of the investigation, particularly the obstruction of justice conclusions?"," asked on Reddit by Lanancer","Myers Wood:","Given what we know now, it is hard to consider the obstruction investigation complete without Trumps testimony. However, Trumps written answers, combined with his considerable public statements, maybe compelling and provide context for why these aggressive prosecutors did not push harder to interview Trump.","Samborn:","I agree but also think that Mueller simply made a strategic decision at some point not to subpoena the president and engage in a year or more of litigation that not only would have delayed completing his mission, but would risk an adverse ruling in the Supreme Court with consequences lasting well beyond the Trump presidency.","Question","How do you feel the course of Russiagate has compared to Watergate in terms of scope, impact and its indelible impact on defining the respective presidency?"," asked on Reddit by Maelstrom218","Barrett:","As a criminal and a government oversight investigation, this isn't Watergate yet.","In 1973, the Senate's Ervin Committee was very actively investigating, including by taking lots of private testimony and then by holding extensive, continuing public hearings, and that was producing many serious allegations of presidential and senior White House official criminality. It produced information on the existence of White House tapes, and that led to the special prosecutor issuing subpoenas and winning litigation to get some of the tapes.","Here, the House is not yet doing that kind of investigation, at least not visibly. It's also not clear that there is that kind of evidence, from insiders, pertaining directly to the president being a criminal.","Of course, seeing Mueller's report on evidence of the president's possible obstructions of justice could add a lot to the current public picture.","Question","What is the point of an independent special counsel if the decision whether to prosecute is made by the attorney general? Isn't the entire point of a special counsel to avoid the specter of a politically motivated cover-up?"," asked on Reddit by Antigonus1i","Samborn:","Unfortunately, and at least for now, I think the attorney general's insertion of his judgment that there was no obstruction of justice does, in fact, undermine the special counsel apparatus.","It is critical that politics not cross the threshold of DOJ, and the special counsel regulations exist to ensure that politics are not infused into investigations and prosecutions that affect the executive branch and have political overtones and repercussions.","Unless or until Barr explains why he took it upon himself to declare no obstruction, public confidence in an independent process could be legitimately questioned.","Barrett:","Mueller is not an \"independent\" special counsel  he is a special counsel within the Department of Justice, appointed by the attorney general (in this case, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein in 2017) and subject to his supervision, and to supervision by Attorney General William Barr's, following his appointment.","Yes, they all work for the president, and that relationship creates the appearance of possible conflict of interest when a special counsel/AG decides that the president is not a criminal.","The U.S. Congress chose to accept this risk in 1999, when it permitted the Independent Counsel law, which provided for court-appointed prosecutors (such as my former boss Lawrence Walsh, and Julie's former boss Ken Starr), to expire. In taking that risk, Congress was avoiding the risk that a court-appointed independent counsel would turn out to be in fact a less-sound decision maker than would an attorney general, whatever his or her possible conflicts of interest. Even assuming everyone's honesty and talent, no approach will be perfect or satisfying to all in every situation.","Question","Mr. Barrett: What are your views on Barr's credibility in light of his role in the pardons after the Iran-Contra affair? What was the mood of Lawrence Walsh's team after President Bush issued those pardons?"," asked on Reddit by Invertedshamrock","Barrett:","Barr has explained, in an oral history interview that he gave after his first stint as AG, that he was very involved in advising President Bush 41 to issue Iran-Contra pardons on Dec. 24, 1992.","As we (Walsh's office) were two weeks from starting a trial (Weinbergers) and had another one (Clarridges) coming in a few months, it was disappointing. Neither Barr nor the White House consulted with Walsh's office about possible pardons, so they thought what they thought on their own.","I think that they proceeded from misimpressions and it was not good decision-making. But it was, assuming nothing corrupt, within the president's constitutional powers  independent counsel Lawrence Walsh criticized the pardons but did not contest their legality.","I have no reason to doubt Barrs integrity. But we can't assess the caliber of his summary of Mueller's report or the soundness of his (Barr's) decision that the evidence that President Trump obstructed justice is insufficient without seeing Mueller's report.","Question","Why do you think Mueller left it up to the AG as to whether or not any further indictments were made?"," asked on Reddit by Kayku25","Myers Wood:","A repeated criticism of other special counsels and independent counsels is that they dragged on too long and wandered into unrelated areas. \nBy closing the report and handing many significant investigations off to other prosecutors, Mueller signaled that he answered the two core questions he was asked, and appropriately referred side prosecutions elsewhere.","Question","What was the biggest challenge your team has had to face in the last few months in related to this investigation?"," asked on Reddit by Lt_Toodles","Samuelsohn:","Sleep. Eating healthy. Getting exercise. Thank god for my wife and cats, too, who played a big role in keeping me sane. Seriously, though, this has been a journey like no other covering this over the last two-plus years. Actually, for me personally, it started around the summer of 2016 when one of my editors assigned me to what we called at the time the \"shenanigans\" beat cause we didn't really know what it was that was happening  we just knew something weird was happening.","There were lots of difficult aspects to covering this whole thing, starting with the sheer cloak-and-dagger aspect of something that isn't really supposed to be taking place in public. I've had a lot of beats over the years, but not in the national security/intelligence/law enforcement world before 2016, so that was a challenge. Also just keeping tabs on everything that has happened -- and trying to stay on top of it all in a news environment that is very different than the one I got started in back in the 1990s (clunky computers, beepers, pay phones).","At POLITICO, we aren't anywhere near as big as the other giant media outlets like NYT and WaPo and AP and all the networks. So, we really tried to pick our punches and right elevated stories that helped connect the dots.","Speaking of dots, one more thing I'd tout that helped me keep everything in order was this award-winning graphic we constructed at the start of 2018 that put all the different people pulled into the Russia saga into one graphic. Enjoy!","Question","Who do you want to play you in the upcoming movie/HBO series?"," asked on Reddit by newpua_bie","Samuelsohn:","Christian Slater or Jason Bateman.

The texture (or \"mouth feel,\" a food writing term that brings an instant grimace) is chewy and dense in both bun and fish. The fillet is comically large and tragically sodden. The tartar sauce is undetectable. If there were any flavor to begin with, I'm unsure I could identify it amidst the dense breading and denser bread.","It lacks any taste or joy. The chain should stick to its tried-and-true turf, because its surf is stagnant.","6. Dairy Queen Alaskan Pacific Cod Sandwich","I've met an iteration of this sandwich once before, and calling the impression \"not good\" would be a gargantuan understatement. This fish sandwich seems to be an update on the distasteful predecessor, improving some qualms and doubling down on others. The bun still slides about on the cod fillet, slicked by a spill of tartar sauce the size to which even the Exxon Valdez would take offense. The lettuce swims about in it like oil-soaked kelp, doomed to spend eternity in condiment purgatory.","However, to give credit where credit is warranted, the fish itself is an improvement. It's not crispy, it's not great  but it's identifiable as something that once swam.","5. Burger King Big Fish Sandwich","Despite the optimistic name, the fillet is far from crispy. The tartar sauce is sweet, with but a whimper of relish or tang. Its sesame seed bun, squashed flat as a flounder, does no one any favors. This fish is gray and sad, like the last lonely tuna at the fish market.","A tiny trio of pickles have retreated to the far side of the sandwich, clearly ashamed of their powerlessness in the face of such culinary chaos; the lettuce is a pale pulp amidst the morass of tartar. The King doth add tartar too much, methinks.","4. McDonald's Filet-O-Fish","I'm at a loss as to what to say about the Filet-O-Fish. It's not a bad sandwich; it's not a good sandwich. It's boring. It's fishy and limp and boring. It's the seafood embodiment of a community theater's inept production of \"Free Willy 2: The Musical.\" The only glimmer of excitement is the tartar sauce, which is more tart relish than mayo.","One wonders why Captain Crook, the sandwich's vintage \"McDonaldland\" nautical mascot and number one fan, so desperately craved Filet-O-Fishes despite what one assumes is a career-related familiarity with actual seafood. He probably should have spent his time and effort pursuing something more rewarding, like a Spanish treasure fleet, or a better makeup artist.","3. White Castle Fish Slider","The slider concept, birthed by White Castle nearly 100 years ago, runs into an issue here: the bun ratio overpowers the tiny fish square. The fish itself  Alaskan pollock, classic fast-food fish fare  is crispier than anticipated. The little American cheese square, its vibrant yet flagging orange corners peeking out from beneath the pillowy bun, does more than one thinks. It stands out more than the other sandwiches' cheese slices, adding a savory warmth  a rounding of flavor that is not expected from such a bland, sorry looking little sandwich. Tartar sauce is recommended, if only to make the downing of the bun-heavy slider easier.","2. Popeyes Seafood Po'boy","The po'boy sandwich, that humble gem of New Orleans, is Popeyes' version of a fishwich. Two fillets of battered fish are crammed into a crusty, fluffy baguette like those served steaming hot on Bourbon Street. The fish is decent for fast-food  it's crispy and flaky, although the trade-off for crispiness is more breading than fish. But with two fillets, there comes a delicate balance between fish and batter. There's a proper, civilized amount of tartar sauce, which goes a long way in this field.","The flavors of the fish and breading are the focal point of the sandwich; however, perhaps unsurprisingly I end up comparing it to the chain's fried chicken and find it wanting in contrast. There's also a shrimp version that I've yet to try.","1. Wendy's Premium Cod Fillet Sandwich","Here sits a compacted, dejected looking sandwich  but the old \"don't judge a book\" adage applies here.","The fish, allegedly \"North Pacific cod,\" is outstandingly crispy. The battered crunch reminds me of an honest-to-goodness fish fry, and the flesh is white and flaky. The pickles are tart and crisp, evenly applied, and the tartar sauce's hint of dill adds a level of nuance that fast-food tartar sauce often so obviously lacks.","There's no cheese, which makes sense to me personally; American cheese and fish shouldn't mix. The normal bun is forgettable, as it should be. The focus here is on the fish. Sure, it's not on the same level as an order of fish and chips from a roadside stand in Ipswich, Massachusetts, but for what one expects out of a fast-food chain, it's shockingly good.","SEE ALSO:\n\t            We taste-tested Chick-fil-A, KFC, and Popeyes and found the best fast-food chicken chain"],"targetCaptions":[]}

So to be completely up to speed with what you need to know going into Captain Marvel, these are the MCU movies you really should try to re-watch before heading to the theater. Dont worry, theres two of them to see.","The original Guardians of the Galaxy introduces the Kree to the MCU, and theyre a huge part of Captain Marvel. Also the characters of Korath and Ronan the Accuser are big parts of Guardians, and youll see younger versions of them in Captain Marvel.","The first Avengers movie is pretty key to a big part of Captain Marvel. In the 2012 movie, it establishes that Project Pegasus was a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. operation studying and making Phase 2 weapons from the Tesseract. There have been a lot of people confused about what Project Pegasus is, and a re-watch of The Avengers would refresh that memory of it being a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. side-project. There are other cool tie-is with The Avengers in Captain Marvel, but I wont spoil those here.","So unlike Infinity War, which does need a bunch of movies to be up to speed, those are really the only two that are really helpful to see prior to seeing Captain Marvel. Theyre not required, but youll understand a the connective tissue a little better if you go into it familiar with those two.","Jeremy Conrad","Jeremy has been active on the web since the 90s.

After retaining Anthony Barr to a multi-year deal, the Minnesota Vikings are strapped for cash like nobody's business this season. As big name free agents are going for big time contracts so far this year, the Vikings are going to be on the hunt for bargains. They'll be looking for experience, they'll be looking for depth, Kalil brings both of those things to the table. The injury should knock his price down and despite the fact that he fizzled out here his first time around, he's still better than many of the other options out there.","At this point in the race, the Vikings can't be too picky. When a player of Kalil's caliber, whatever caliber you think that is, becomes available and should do so at a reasonable price, you have to make the call.","Bringing Kalil in gives you options for depth at left tackle, gives you the opportunity to move someone from left to right and then gives you a chance to move someone from the island on the outside into a guard spot.","At least put a call in. He may not be interested, he may demand a starting role, he might be too expensive, but it can't hurt.","Vikings Blog","Want to know more about the Vikings Blog?

Now I eat my dinner and complete a short stroll by the time that I previously would have just been arriving home.","\"As a person who works in a busy atmosphere and stressful environment, being able to spare time for myself has added great value to my quality of life,\" he adds, mentioning uneducated, impatient and distressed drivers as one of the many reasons behind traffic stress.","Cezayir Dogan, the editor-in-chief of Radio Traffic, Istanbul's only traffic radio, says: \"There is no doubt that the number one problem of Istanbul is traffic congestion.","\"And people are closely following the projects on this subject. But I need to add that 'solution' is not the word we should use, 'bearable' is.","\"There is no traffic-free metropol in the world. So we cannot expect 'zero traffic' in Istanbul, but we can envision 'bearable traffic'.","\"Candidates are well-prepared for this battle. They are promising more metro lines, more bicycle roads, more public transportation routes and smart solutions.","\"And as far as I can see, voters are quite hopeful about their projects.\"","Dogan insists that the government should focus on \"inspection, education and coordination\" as much as major infrastructure projects.","His radio station has aired interviews with both Yildirim and Imamoglu, as well as many more district candidates, in which the traffic issue has been hotly debated.","Erdogan seeking 13th successive poll victory","Istanbul's local elections are the point where it all started for Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The 1994 mayoral race was the first rung in Erdogan's ladder of election victories.","\"The one who takes Istanbul will take Turkey\" were the words he used in 2014, during the last local election campaigns, and that slogan turned out to be accurate.","For 25 years, opposition parties have been unable to engineer a happy ending in Istanbul and in the meantime Erdogan has come out on top in three local elections, five general elections, three referendums and one presidential election.","Determined to add a 13th win to his streak, Erdogan has personally been conducting election meetings.","In an atmosphere where Turkey's economic growth has slowed and a drop in the value of the Turkish lira has reduced peoples' purchasing power, his speeches contain a vast variety of subjects, ranging from the New Zealand terror attack to Israeli atrocities in Gaza.","He has also managed to appeal to his popular base with references to billions of dollars worth of investments such as the new Istanbul Airport, which aims to be the busiest in Europe, a 63km long new train line, city hospitals and the Camlica mosque, which can accommodate more then 60,000 people.","'Look in the mirror and straighten up'","On the opposition side, Imamoglu has sought to distance himself from his CHP party, as the country's founding political party struggles with a candidature and leadership crisis.","Attempting to separate himself from the party's quarrels, Imamoglu has sought out new followers, even reciting the Quran in memory of the victims of the New Zealand terror attack, despite his secular party's background.","As assertive as every other politician, Imamoglu claims that he will win the race in Istanbul and this victory will force the ruling AKP party to \"look in the mirror and straighten up\".","But regardless of who wins, Yusuf is not hopeful for a remedy to Istanbul's traffic crisis and cannot see a solution to the traffic congestion in the near future.","\"Istanbul's population is huge and the transportation system and road network are not meeting the needs.","\"The more the roads and transportation system are developed, the more new buildings are built, just presents an opportunity for more people to come.\"","Recommended","Read more","Top Menu En","Countries","About"," Middle East Eye 2019- all rights reserved.

The key word in that development: Tour.","This isnt expected to be Berrys only free agent visit, unless Dallas is offering a respectable top end safety deal out of the gate.","A source familiar with the mutual interest between Dallas and Berry said Tuesdays visit will be more of a feeling out process between the two sides, centered largely on Berrys health and potential fit with the team. If both sides are happy with the results, talks are expected to advance into potential financial terms. But one thing is clear already after Berry wasreleased by the Kansas City Chiefs last week: Its too early to talk about the five-time Pro Bowler being a bargain signing in free agency. Especially with Dallas being his first visit and at least 10 teams still having more than $30 million in functional salary-cap space to work with.","[Best bracket wins $1M: Enter our free contest now! | Printable bracket]","4 safeties set ceiling on free-agent market","Although his free agency just began, Berry is believed to be looking for a team that offers him the best hybrid opportunity of winning while getting paid near the top end of the safety table. Thats a key reality, considering the safety market has been significantly raised this offseason by a trio of deals forLandon Collins (six years, $84 million),Earl Thomas (four years, $55 million),Tyrann Mathieu (three years, $42 million)andLamarcus Joyner (four years, $42 million). The major hindrance for Berry is the signing of that foursome  along with a multitude of other safeties  has significantly narrowed the free agent demand at the position.","Ultimately, that could dramatically impact the type of contract Berry is offered  not to mention the actual number of free agent visits available to him. While a one-year prove it deal appears to be very unlikely, its not out of the question until the rest of his market solidifies.","How strong is Cowboys shot of landing Berry?","In terms of where that market could go: There is a key comparison in that previous group of safeties that Cowboys fans should keep their eyes on. That would be Thomas, who was drafted the same year as Berry (2010) and will also be (like Berry) 30 when next season begins. After the Collins and Mathieu deals, Thomas landed his big contract with theBaltimore Ravens, despite a variety of health issues that impacted his past three seasons. Like Berry, Thomas missed the majority of last season, breaking his leg in a Week 4 win over theArizona Cardinals.","While the Cowboys might balk at the comparison between Berry and Thomas at the negotiating table, they can expect that general parallel to be drawn. It doesnt mean Berry is necessarily expecting to land Thomas money, but hes not going to come cheaply by any means, either. And that might be precisely why hes expected to shop around before signing his next deal.","The good news for Cowboys fans is Dallas is expected to get a good look at Berrys health, which is believed to be trending up after he finished last season with Kansas City and learned he wouldnt need surgery to square away a bothersome heel. At the time of his release by the Chiefs, Berry was preparing to take part in all offseason activities and be 100 percent by the start of training camp.","More from Yahoo Sports:","Retired NFL star is unrecognizable one year later","The ACC team that's pretty mad about March","The 5 biggest snubs on Selection Sunday","Hard to believe this NCAA matchup was random","What to Read Next"],"targetCaptions":[]}

So lets examine whether they really deserve it.","Well tell you whats true. You can form your own view.","From\n    15p\n    0.18\n    $0.18\n    USD 0.27\n    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.","Lets start with the former Congressman from Texas. Even though he has already had his photo taken by Annie Liebovitz, Beto is by and large nothing more than a middle-of-the-road white guy with money, who lost to Senator Ted Cruz in the 2018 Texas senatorial race.","I will admit: Beto garnered a substantial following on social media and in the press because he was running against Ted Cruz, who is, in my opinion, about as regressive and bigoted as it gets. But that wasnt because he had anything special to offer or any clear stances on policy issues. Betos failure to beat Cruz in the Texas senatorial race does not bode well either for a presidential win, regardless of how he is doing in the polls.","Even more nauseating was ORourkes Im just born to do this statement in this months Vanity Fair interview and his subsequent comments about how his wife is raising his kids with a little help from him. His mediocrity is appalling: as a man, a person and definitely as a candidate. His out-of-touch fatherhood remarks also show that he hasnt taken the time to acknowledge or examine his white privilege or his male privilege. This is not the person America needs in the White House. This is not the person who can undo anything that Trump has done in the past four years. And this is definitely not the person who will beat Trump in the upcoming presidential debates.","Turning to Senator Kamala Harris of California, the states former attorney general has been generally let off the hook in terms of public criticism. The media has instead focused on her soundbite-worthy grilling of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his confirmation to the Court. The idea of having a woman of colour in the White House has overtaken the truth about her conservative past as a prosecutor and attorney general of the Golden State.","Harris drafted a law that allowed police to go after parents of minors who were playing truant, many of whom came from single-parent households where the childs guardian had two or more jobs and couldnt always make sure their kids made it to school. Drug arrests also went up 18 per cent while she was District Attorney. Harris is one of several former prosecutors who have now rebranded themselves as liberals to run for political office  but not everyone is fooled.","Shape\n    Created with Sketch.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\nWho could be running against Trump in 2020?","1/23 Bernie Sanders","2/23  Hillary Clinton","3/23 Joe Biden","4/23 Kamala Harris","5/23 Elizabeth Warren","6/23 Beto ORourke","7/23 Wayne Messam","8/23 Kirsten Gillibrand","9/23 Cory Booker","10/23 John Delaney","11/23 Julian Castro","12/23 Tulsi Gabbard","13/23 Pete Buttigieg","14/23 Andrew Yang","15/23 Marianne Williamson","16/23 John Kerry","17/23 Michael Bloomberg","18/23 Howard Schultz","19/23 Eric Holder","20/23 Eric Swalwell","21/23 Terry McAuliffe","22/23 Sherrod Brown","23/23 Mitch Landrieu","1/23 Bernie Sanders","2/23  Hillary Clinton","3/23 Joe Biden","4/23 Kamala Harris","5/23 Elizabeth Warren","6/23 Beto ORourke","7/23 Wayne Messam","8/23 Kirsten Gillibrand","9/23 Cory Booker","10/23 John Delaney","11/23 Julian Castro","12/23 Tulsi Gabbard","13/23 Pete Buttigieg","14/23 Andrew Yang","15/23 Marianne Williamson","16/23 John Kerry","17/23 Michael Bloomberg","18/23 Howard Schultz","19/23 Eric Holder","20/23 Eric Swalwell","21/23 Terry McAuliffe","22/23 Sherrod Brown","23/23 Mitch Landrieu","If most Democrats agree that the most important issue in the 2020 election is to get rid of the Cheeto-faced, flaming xenophobe in the White House, then we cannot support either Harris or ORourke, as nice as they might be to watch on TV or look at in magazines.","If either of these candidates truly care about the future of their country then they will recognize that the America that wants Trump gone  a liberal and diverse America  wants a candidate who has a history of standing up for civil and human rights: we want a real liberal. Bernie Sanders, for example. The man didnt dedicate his career to incarcerating people; he was himself arrested for his civil rights stance. Or Stacey Abrams, the Ivy League-educated attorney and former candidate for Governor of Georgia who recently gave the Democratic response to the State of the Union address; or Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey.","The main reason the man who currently occupies the white house won in the first place is because loud, unqualified candidates were given too much airtime. So Americans need to wake up and take a good, hard look at the Democratic candidates histories and what they actually stand for, rather than the shiny quality of their recent profiles. In this election we cant take any more chances. These are indeed dangerous times.","Well tell you whats true. You can form your own view.","At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

And since no plot details or even a title has been announced for the project, fans are pretty much at liberty to spin whatever theory they want about the movie, including the suggestion that it might be the long-awaited Green Lantern Corps film.","Thomas Polito of Geeks WorldWide recently took to Twitter with a couple of posts observing some vague similarities between the two Warner Bros projects. For one thing, the Nolan movies July 17th, 2020, release date falls somewhat close to the June 19th date that was announced back in 2015 for Green Lantern Corps.","On top of that, its argued that recently reported cast members Robert Pattinson and John David Washington would make good fits for Hal Jordan and Jon Stewart, respectively. Lastly, its suggested that the age-appropriate female lead and older male co-star that Nolan is reportedly looking for could be referring to Carol Ferris and Sinestro.","MORE FROM THE WEB","Though Polito may not have been 100% serious in his speculation, fans are already sold on the idea, even if most of them will need a lot more evidence than this to start believing that the Dark Knight helmsman is returning to superhero cinema. And while its currently looking highly unlikely that a Green Lantern Corps film will even come out in 2020  let alone that Nolans the one directing it  surely theres no harm in letting people dream a while.","In any case, with Nolans movie set to begin filming this summer, we can hopefully expect a few more details to emerge in the coming months. Either way, well find out what the directors been secretly cooking up when it arrives in theaters on July 17th, 2020.","Source:  Twitter","MORE NEWS FROM THE WEB","TRENDING","You May Like","New World War Z Gameplay Footage Shows Off The Games Depth","The Walking Dead Fans Are Furious Another Gay Characters Been Killed Off","Watch Avengers: Endgame Stars On The Guardians Of The Galaxy Ride","Dave Bautista To Star In Zack Snyders Army Of The Dead","Angelina Jolies Role In The Eternals Has Been Revealed","Linda Hamilton Says The Last Three Terminator Films Were Forgettable","Apex Legends Has Permanently Banned Cheaters And Theyre Not Happy","Prince Harry Would Like To Ban Fortnite In The United Kingdom","Idris Elba Will Play An Original Character In The Suicide Squad, Not Deadshot","Robert Downey Jr. Kicks Off Avengers: Endgame Press Tour With Awesome Video","X-Men Star James Marsden Open To Returning As Cyclops In The MCU","Rian Johnson Doesnt Mind If J.J.

It never came. Fan clamoring fell on deaf ears in the teams front office, which preferred to lean on its then-renowned player development system to unveil its next crop of new-wave talent, already, it often seemed, in full bloom.","Struggles followed. Stalwarts Starling Marte and Jung-Ho Kang were sidelined with off-field issues, Andrew McCutchen was an avatar of his former self, and the top end of the rotation looked more like the middle. The teams vaunted Shark Tank bullpen had been drained. Nascent cornerstoneGregory Polancohad hit the skids.The window, suddenly, seemed closed.","But as the team plodded through a mediocre 2018 season (and after McCutchen and Gerrit Cole had been sent packing in the months prior), the brass finally showed its sword, sending out multiple top prospects in deadline deals for late-inning reliever Keone Kela and peripheral ace Chris Archer. It felt like Pittsburgh, so often content to fold, may finally be primed to throw its chips into the middle.","Alas, as the offseasons nears its end, the Pirates are still playing coy. The team didnt spend more than $3MM on a single free agent this offseason. Its only major trade  an attempt to shore up shortstop, its weakest position in recent years  brought back a 27-year-old utility player in Erik Gonzalez as its headliner. Gonzalez, whos slashed .263/.292/.389 in just 275 career MLB plate appearances, will get shorts first crack this season.","Another former Indian, Lonnie Chisenhall, was brought in on the cheap for corner-outfield insurance; the team will cash in the policy immediately, as Gregory Polanco, who finally broke out in 18, will miss at least the first few weeks with a shoulder injury. Chisenhalls last two seasons have been marred by injury; theyve also been fueled by rockets, as the 30-year-old has posted successive career-highs in hard-hit rate, OBP, and wRC+, and appeared finally to be fulfillinghis early-career promise when on the field.","Jung Ho Kang, the soon-to-be 32-year-old third baseman, is the real wildcard here. The team would like to find regular at-bats for Colin Moran, but Kang, whos posted a team-best 129 career wRC+, could anchor the lineup if he can somehow regain his form. After multiple DUI arrests in his native Korea, and a sexual assault charge levied in his brief time in the states, Kangs leash will be short  too long, still, for some fans, but the Pirates clearly know what they have in the former MVP of the KBO, and will be over the moon if he can at least approximate his mid-decade output.","Under-the-radar bullpen pickups Lyons, Maurer, Barrett, and Liriano (once a key figure in the teams renaissance) endeavor to give the unit the depth it lacked in recent years. If even one can be righted under the mystical tutelage of pitching coach Ray Searage, the Tank may yet be full again.","Jordan Lyles will bring his steadily-climbing fastball velocity and much-improved curveball to the battle for the fifth rotation spot. Prolonged stretches of effectiveness have thus far eluded him in his eight-year MLB career. By effectively swapping him in for Ivan Nova, the Pirates shaved over $6MM of payroll but parted with Novas steady (if unspectacular) output.","Questions Remaining","The outfield unit is set and could be a fairly good one if Chisenhall is healthy and Marte and Corey Dickerson can repeat their 2018 efforts. Melky Cabrera is presently battling with J.B. Shuck, Patrick Kivlehan, and Nick Franklin for a roster spot and a reserve role. Theyll have to beat out 40-man members Pablo Reyes and Jose Osuna for a seat at the table.","Catcher (Francisco Cervelli and Jacob Stallings, pending the return ofElias Diaz) and first base (Josh Bell) are settled. Otherwise, there are even greater questions in the infield but also quite a few possibilities. Third base will be covered at the outset by a Moran/Kang platoon, while Adam Frazier will factor heavily at second and Gonzalez figures to have the inside track at short.","Its not hard to envision changes at the 4-5-6 positions throughout the season. Shortstop is the real issue here, but the team, with its grounder-heavy staff, has never much seemed to care about offense at the position, instead entrenching sure-handed gamers like Jordy Mercer andClint Barmesthere in the last few seasons. Gonzalez is cut from similar cloth.Former top prospectKevin Newman who once rankedas high as #23 overall on Keith Laws list is hot on Gonzalezs heels, though he hasnt hit much after a midseason promotion to AA in 2016.Kevin Krameris another well-regarded middle-infield prospect; he has served mostly at second base in the minors. Kramer struggled in his first taste of the majors last year, but only after turning in an eye-opening run at Triple-A. Reyes may also factor in the infield mix. Top prospects Cole Tucker (shortstop) andKeBryan Hayes(third base) are nearing MLB readiness and could force their way up during the season to come.","The back-end of the rotation could be a problem: Joe Musgrove, though possessing of the ideal command/sink combination that drives the organization wild, has a checkered injury history and again dealt with multiple ailments last season. Trevor Williams has solidified his spot, but he rarely misses a bat (his swing-and-miss rate was the leagues third-lowest last season) and ERA estimators (xFIP, in particular) are not optimistic.If either falters, or misses significant time, the Pirates better hope that Nick Kingham (torched in limited action last season) or top prospect Mitch Keller is ready to make the jump. You have to squint to see Lyles as a suitable replacement for Nova, leaving the Bucs heavily reliant upon their preexisting collection of young arms.","What to Expect in 19","The NL Central looks to be a thresher. The best-case scenario still has the Pirates contending for the Central crown, but its perched atop a heap of ifs: Archer returning to his dominant 2013-15 form, the back end of the rotation staying healthy and delivering quality innings, Polanco making a swift recovery and showing no ill effects, Frazier serving non-believers a season-long taste of crow, one of Moran, Kang, or Chisenhall emerging as a middle-of-the-order threat, and good health abounding. The likeliest outcome is that the Pirates hover in equilibrium, still stuck an arms-length away from the elusive treasure.","How would you grade the Pirates offseason efforts?

After the Archer and Kela acquisitions, the team is right on that line of good and pretty good. This year, however, in their division, good to pretty good might get you 4th place.","I dont really have any problems with the moves they have made this offseason. In fact, Im a big fan of their moves. Chisenhall is a great addition to the roster, as is Gonzalez. The real problem is that they needed to get another difference-maker (or two). A more solid starter than Lyles, Kingham, and Brault and a real starting shortstop would have been the clearest areas to be more aggressive. Their non-moves seem to indicate that they are banking on Tucker and Keller being productive in MLB relatively soon.","For Petes sake Jose Iglesias and Ervin Santana signed MINOR LEAGUE CONTRACTS! Even those two are likely to upgrade the team to a decent degree. Thats not including other pitchers that signed for cheap or the pitchers or shortstops that could have been traded for.minor cost. Simply missed opportunities.","However, that all being said, I DO think its possible for the Pirates to win the division. Milwaukees rotation looks bad; Cubs could stagnate; Cards have question marks; and Ill believe the Reds when I see it.","The Ghost of Bobby Bonilla","3 weeks ago","I just came here to mention that this team has the worst ownership group in all of professional sports.  Bob freaking Nutting.","Shannon Wolfe","3 weeks ago","I ranked it as a solid D. I wish they made a bigger move at SS and feel the rotation is going to rank 18th-22nd in the league by the end of the season. Pirates really havent added a thump of a bat at 3rd or RF (with Polanco out for almost half season). I havent been impressed with any of the moves this offseason. Chisenhill is injury prone. Liriano is a washed up pitcher. Lyles is a bullpen piece as is Brault. Musgrave has the potential to get hurt each year. At least 1-3 starters look decent on paper.","OF is a question mark in my mind. Can Marte step up this year? Will Dickerson repeat or bust this year? Can Polanco come back as strong as last year after his surgery? And not to mention my doubts at 3rd. I think Moran and Kang are busts. I think Kang better days are behind him. Moran is just not a everyday starter for a contending club. He is at best a PH off the bench. I think 1B and Josh Bell is not even going to be league average. He doesnt have the pop that a 1B should have. I think he will hit for good average and play average Defense.","Frazier got my attention the last few years and I am glad he is getting his chance to showcase what he can do at 2nd. Ive also waited for Diaz to make his mark in the MLB. I think Diaz can be better than Cervelli or Russell Martin offensively and slightly lower in play calling and framing than the other two are. I am happy to see a healthy Tallion this year. Archer should benefit with sub par defense behind him. Williams (if he can keep the ball on the ground) should add to a nice trio.","Again, better signings at 3B/SS/OF/ 4th and 5th SP would have given them at least a B in my grading. FA wasnt great but wasnt bad either. I think the FO dropped the ball again this year. I just have some hope we wont be in the cellar this year.","mpoweror","3 weeks ago","Lyles/Kingham/Brault = 5th rotation spot.

A previous version mistakenly described Mr Shapiro as an alt-right sage and a pop idol of the alt right. In fact, he has been strongly critical of the alt-right movement. We apologise.","EVERYTHING ABOUT Ben Shapiro is polished. His answers are smooth. His appearance is neat. His academic pedigree is impeccable. He blasted into the public sphere at the tender age of 20 with his first book, Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate Americas Youth, that made him a hero to many young conservatives.","Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.","After a stint at Breitbart, the veritable headquarters of right-wing media, he created his own outlet, The Daily Wire, catering to hyperventilating conservatives. At 35, his seventh book was published this month, The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great (Broadside Books). In it, he argues that the dismissal of Judeo-Christian values and the Greek tradition of reason leads to subjectivism and individualism that is behind the Wests social and political malaise.","His views are classically religious-conservative. He suggests that transgender people suffer a mental disorder; he opposes same-sex couples raising children; he has said (and sort of retracted) that Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage.","Mr Shapiro not only courts controversy, he relies on it. It serves as an opening salvo to be heard above the din in digital media. Once the spotlight is on, he fights his way out with nuance and intellect. If I can use the methodologies of gaining eyeballs to get people to look into deeper content, then Im going to do that, he tells The Economist.","Mr Shapiro discusses Western values, freedom of speech, why he is only sometimes Trump and the criticism that he is Islamophobic, in an interview with Anne McElvoy for The Economist Asks podcast and our Open Future initiative. The podcast is available below. It is followed by condensed portions of the interview.","*  * *","The Economist: In your latest book you spend a lot of time talking about whats going wrong in society. What do you think has been eroded?","Ben Shapiro: What is eroding is the fundamental principles upon which the civilisation is based. The idea that each of us are individuals made in the image of God; that we each have individual value; that we can use reason to have discussions with one another, which is the fundamental underlying assumption for free speech and for democracy; the idea that as individuals we have rights that are independent of the government providing those rights.","All of those values are being eroded because, first of all, we got rid of some of the assumptions, or at least weve fought some of the religious underpinnings of the West. And then in turn, weve fought back against the notion of reason itself. And were reverting to a sort of tribalism we see in our politics that's getting quite ugly.","The Economist: Its a faith-based argument, fundamentally. But if we look at that argument whether its the Judeo bit or the Christian bit many people simply interpret those ideas differently. They have done throughout history; they do so the more in pluralist societies. So youre on slightly shifting ground aren't you from the get-go?","Mr Shapiro: Well, not really. The argument that I make is that there are certain fundamental principles that have always been held and have not always been fulfilled in Judeo-Christian values. And those are in tension withand rubbing up against but mutually buttressing, counterintuitivelythe ideas of reason. The whole point of the book is not that everybody needs to go back to church alone. Its that we all need to use the ideas that were also brought to us by the Greeks, and balance those, and use them in tension, with the ideas that were brought to us by Judeo-Christian ideals.","Im not claiming that a sort of theocracy is the purpose of life. My point is that there are certain religious fundamental principles that were created by Judeo-Christian value-systems. And that those struggled with, and occasionally gain dominance overin unfortunate waysreason itself. And then reason gained dominance over religion, and that had similarly unfortunate effects.","I say in the conclusion to the book that civilisations that discard Judeo-Christian values end up in really dark places. And civilisations that discard reason end up in similarly dark places. I think that the mistake of secular humanism is to believe, like the French Revolution believed, that you strangle the last king with the entrails of the last priest, and that what arises is some sort of glorious utopia. I dont think that thats correct. I think that you have to understand where it is that we have come from, so that we can actually take what is good from what weve had and maintain that and cherish that.","The Economist: A lot of things that made the West great in terms of wealth and subsequent power cant always be easily defined as moral in the sense that youve laid out. We have empires built in large part, for instance, on slavery.","Mr Shapiro: Of course thats true. Its also true that slavery is a universal human institution until its abolition essentially by the Judeo-Christian West.","The Economist: Yeah, but it took quite a while, didnt it?","Mr Shapiro: Of course it took quite a while. And that of course its a great moral evil. The argument Im making is not that civilisation was suddenly brought into being at one moment in time and then progress stopped. The argument of the book is that there are these principles that are in constant turmoil with each other, and that the interplay between these principles creates the West. And that to ignore some of those principles, to read some of those principles out of history, to assume that those principles can be destroyed at will, and that we can maintain the upper levels of a building whose foundations weve just done away withI think thats a mistake.","The Economist: You talk about this new social fabric. What is the solution? What would the new social fabric look like? How would we know if we had begun to recreate it in the way that you think would be beneficial?","Mr Shapiro: We have to have a common definition of what liberty constitutes, what choice constitutes, and we also have to rebuild a lot of the social institutions that have collapsed. Now, historically those have been churchesjust realistically speaking, the place where most people found their common cause and common meaning was in churches. But social science research says they dont only have to be churches. They can be social clubs. They can be bowling leagues; other ways of reaching out to each other.","But the more durable those ways are of reaching out to each other, the more we can, at the same time, maintain our individuality, and also see the common humanity in the other. It is the sort of point that Robert Putnam makes in Bowling Alone. The Harvard sociologist, he makes the point that diversity itself is not necessarily a strengthening factor in a society, but when there is a society that has a common purpose, then the diversity definitely helps the society.","One of the things weve seen in the West isas multiculturalism has come to the forethe attempt to shatter the common purpose, and then maintain that diversity, and expect that all youll get is benefit, I think is a bit foolhardy.","The Economist: You have a big following. Youre laying out a stall here. Youre taking on some ideas that youve embraced over the years, and what youve written now. Why should we listen to you? What is different about your perspective or authority?","Mr Shapiro: All the stuff that I think we generally agree is good in the West: freedom, liberalism, democracy, human rights. An extraordinarily prosperous economywe live at the most prosperous free time in the history of humanity. How did those things come about?","Because the question isnt What bad things did Western civilization do alone. I mean, we should obviously look at this stuff; that stuff is important. But I think its important to note that the great difference that has happened in the world is the West.","If you believe that the West has had a generalised beneficial and salutary impact on the world, particularly over the last few centuries, were going to have to look at the values that inspired that, because that is something thats different.","The Economist: But we also have to look at the challenges within it. [] Isnt the conversation about privilege, about prosperity, about the gains of prosperity and who shares them? Isn't that just a very old religious message, which is that we ought to look after those weaker than ourselves, and to keep thinking about it proactively. Therefore, what the West stands for must keep looking at itself and must keep changing.","Mr Shapiro: I certainly agree that the basic notion of fairness itself is sort of embedded in the human minda notion of fairness that I largely believe is incorrect, which is the fairness of outcome. With that said, there is nothing in basic religious theology that suggests that just because somebody is successful and somebody else is not successful, that some sort of cosmic injustice has been done.","In secular countries, what weve seen is the attempt to supplant a religious-based social fabric with a governmental fabric. The idea being that we all agree that we have to take care of our neighbors. As a religious person, I want to care for my neighbor; its a biblical injunction. Thats not the same thing as suggesting that an overarching government has the power to confiscate wealth from some and give it to others.","The Economist: Well, the disagreement over that points sits right at the heart of the political debate in America. You lament the fact that its become so acrimonious. Youve said, Politics has become a blood sport. So, what can be done about that?","Mr Shapiro: I think that the first thing that can be done is to recognise that we actually do in the West share a lot more in common than separates us. I think that we have to agree on some fundamental principles: the idea of freedom of speech; the idea that speech is not violence; the notion that we can convince each other with argumentation; that reason actually matters. If we agree on all of those things, and then we are willing to grant the other side of the debate the credibility to make its arguments, then we are likely to have a less acrimonious debate.","I think one of the things that has happened is that we have decided that, thanks to narratives of victimisation and privilegesome of which are rooted in real history, but I think draw bad conclusionswhat weve decided instead is that we have to argue from identity, as opposed to arguing from the notion that we are all individual human beings that have the capacity for reason.","The Economist: It seems quite odd to hear people arguing for an end or smoothing over of division who, it seems to me, you quite like division. You like pitching into the argument, often in very strong terms, which some people find divisive and think simply amplifies that sort of screaming chamber. Are you a bit guilty of the very thing that you say you want to cure?","Mr Shapiro: You know, Im sure I am. I am trying to work on it. You know, one of the things that","The Economist: Give us the evidence that you are working on it! What are you working on?","Mr Shapiro: Well, I mean I think that the book is one attempt. But if you look at the fact that I have reached out to many folks on the left to have discussions. If you look at my actual college appearances and not just the two-minute clipped YouTube Shapiro destroys kind of stuff, but you actually look at the exchanges. These are very sober, rational, non-demonising discussions.","The Economist: And are you saying that you disown that kind of way of handling clips or of promoting that you rely onIm sure well hear it after this show, as others: Shapiro destroys McElvoy! Or AOC. Or whoever it is","Mr Shapiro: Lets put it this way: Is that what I want from the debate? No. Is that a way of getting people to watch deeper content? Sure. I mean, we also have to acknowledge how the market works, and the market does work in a way to generate these sorts of views on those sorts of videos. We dont make the vast majority of those. And when I have control of it I try to downplay that sort of stuff. I also make distinctions between various political factions.","But this sort of idea here is that we do live in a fraught political time, and if I can use the methodologies of gaining eyeballs to get people to look into deeper content, then Im going to do that, as opposed to simply disengaging from the realities of the political world. Now with all of that said, I do think there is a large-scale difference between the kind of partisan bickering that were talking about and the actual tribal political warfare that were seeing.","The Economist: What is the responsibility of people with particularly influential presence on social-media platforms? To be fair to say that you are one of them: Do you have any moral responsibility to diminish divisions?","Mr Shapiro: Only where the divisions are bad faith divisions. What I do have a responsibility to do is say that these are discussions that we can have about issues. That I am not divided from Bernie Sanders by virtue of my background. That Im not a member of a tribe that prevents us from having a conversation in the first place.","The sort of tribal politics that we are seeing, and that I think does in some ways escalate toward violence, is a politics where we say, You cannot have a discussion with me because you have not had my experiences. The intersectional politics of the United States is really dangerous and its not just on the left side of the aisle. Its on the right side of the aisle, as well.","The Economist: You use quite out-there language. Youve talked about debunking the myth of the tiny, radical Muslim minority in a video that was criticised quite widely as being Islamophobic. Do you sometimes stand back and say, I might have gone too far?","Mr Shapiro: I mean sure. I think any good person has to sit there and thinkwhenever something terrible happens, or even when something not terrible is happeningbe self-critical and try to determine: Could I have done better here?","The particular video that youre citing is a complete recitation of Pew Research Statistics. So that particular video being used as evidence that Im Islamophobic, when Im literally just reading poll results, I've always found to be kind of shocking.","Ive always found shocking also the notion that if you criticise radical Islam, or if you criticise views that are radical, that this is somehow you justifying the murder of innocent people who are not radical, or justifying murder on the basis of views itself. Thats a jump that I don't see anyone rational making. But you know, there are a lot of rational people who want to connect speech with violence.","The Economist: Lets come to a saying that you were very famous for: Facts dont care about your feelings. But we might say in the last three years voters on left and right have rather abandoned technocratic politics or so-called evidence-based politics in favor of something else; something more urgent, more direct, something more populist. Wouldnt it be more accurate to say that modern politics is about feelings, and feelings dont care that much about facts.","Mr Shapiro: Yeah, I think thats a more accurate statement of where we are politically. I think what weve seen is a failure to acknowledge that we live in a shared reality, and that facts have to be the basis of any contention that were making. Instead, we are happy to draw emotionally manipulative narratives from isolated incidents, or alternatively to ignore broad trends of facts in favour of particular narratives. That obviously is dangerous stuff. I hope that Im the kind of personI try to be the kind of personwho can be convinced by evidence that Im wrong.","But I at least try to be evidence-based in my politics. I hope that we can all be a little bit more evidence-based in our politics.","The Economist: What about President Trump? Youve said you are sometimes Trump. What determines actually which days youre feeling Trump-y and which days you feel a bit anti-Trump?","Mr Shapiro: It depends. If you do something dumb or horrible that day. I mean thats really what it comes down to. When I say Sometimes Trump, what I mean is that he is the President of the United States, in this case. I would say I was Sometimes Obama meaning that if Obama did something that I likedwhich was exceedingly rarethen I was a fan of it. It's the same thing.","So when President Trump says very foolish or counterproductive things, then thats bad. When he nominates a Supreme Court justice who says that he will hew to the original meaning of the Constitution, then that's good. Im not going to criticise him when I think hes doing something right. Im not going to ignore it when I think hes doing something wrong.","The Economist: How is the 2020 American presidential election looking to you?","Mr Shapiro: If I had to give odds right now, Id say that President Trump is an odds-on favorite to lose in 2020. I think that he only has about a 40% chance of winning.","The Economist: Whats changed; what's gone so wrong on the right in America, if this president upended all these liberal expectations only has a 40% chance of winning again?","Mr Shapiro: I think that it hasnt gone better because in part, President Trump is President Trump. Hes a polarising figure. He didnt take advantage of the opportunity of the presidency to grow his base. He didnt take an opportunity to look like a more compassionate person, if [he] were capable of that. He didnt educate the public on all of the things he's done right. Hes distracted the public with all of the things hes done wrong.","If somebody could have smashed his phone the day he took office and he had not tweeted for the last two and a half years, then I think that his approval rating would be five to 10 points higher. But hes a constant obstacle in his own way.","The Economist: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?","Mr Shapiro: I dont think Ocasio-Cortez has any national appeal. I think that shes very appealing to the media. I think shes very appealing to a small base of very radical left-wingers. But she does encompass exactly what the media are looking for, which is a person who is quite attractive in her presentation, who looks like shes having funwhich is half the battlewith her Instagram stuff, and who is also deeply radical, and boils down complex arguments to bumper stickers, like em or hate em.","The Economist: Do you respect her?","Mr Shapiro: In what sense?","The Economist: Politically.","Mr Shapiro: No. I dont respect her politics. I dont respect her intellectual command of the issues. I respect that shes been able to command enormous amounts of media attention. But no, I think that shes a bad expositor of her own values.","The Economist: I cant resist a last, quick-fire round if you'll just bear with me. Your dream date with a moral philosopher? And I'm going to allow you an alive or dead.","Mr Shapiro: Oh, OK, wow. On the religious side, you know Im a religious Jew, so that means youre almost obligated religiously to say Moses. But putting aside religious philosophers, the two that come to mind immediatelywell, threethat come to mind immediately, are Aquinas, Maimonides, and Locke.","The Economist: That's quite a date. Thats a heavy night out, isnt it?","Mr Shapiro: Well do some round-robin. Ten-minute dating. Itll be a party.","The Economist: Shots with Locke! Nightmare date: the one that wouldnt work out?","Mr Shapiro: Certainly a date with Marx would go very poorly. Number one because he was not fond of the Jews. And number two, he was wrong about pretty much everything.","The Economist: Last one. You talk about God: he, she or it?","Mr Shapiro: Well, I mean, it in the technical sense; he in the homologic sense.","The Economist: Noted.","Open Future","by K.N.C. & A.M.","Not quiet on the western frontKhalifa Haftar, Libyas strongest warlord, makes a push for Tripoli","Corporate crisesScandals suggest standards have slipped in corporate America","From the archive: The World Banks new leaderWhy Malpass should get the job","!!!!!!!Is Billie Eilish really changing pop stardom?","Join them.

Basically, you're always that special, unique, wonderful you, no matter how many tequila shots you foolishly ended up taking on your birthday.","Sloshed for Science","For the study, the researchers from University of Missouri and Purdue University sought to find out if \"drunk personalities\" are a thing or not. They specifically tested if \"differences between sober and intoxicated personality expression can be observed reliably\" by friends during some drunk game-playing. Two weeks prior to the experiment, the researchers had the 156 participants complete surveys describing their typical sober and drunk personalities. Next, the team gave half of the participants booze, then had their friends join them in the lab to play games meant to bring out different personality traits. The drinkers rated their own in-the-moment personality traits during the session while trained (and sober) raters assessed the same traits.

We have no policy of discrimination against any group, and we do not have a political or social agenda. More than 120,000 people from different backgrounds and beliefs represent the Chick-fil-A brand.\" Despite their claims, the company admitted as recently as June 2018 to bankrolling anti-LGBTQ organizations like Fellowship Of Christian Athletes, which prohibits \"any 'homosexual acts,' even for married couples\" and The Salvation Army, which has an extensive record of anti-LGBTQ advocacy.","When I was growing up, there were few things as exciting to me as a trip to theRegency Mallin Racine, Wisconsin, for lunch atChick-fil-A.","My family didnt have much money then so eating out was a rare treat. But when the trip includedwaffle fries an ingenious food so alien to southern Wisconsin in the early 80s that they seemed like small, salty miracles to my tiny, still-soft mind  it was almost too much for me to take.","Still, as delicious as the Georgia-based companys fried foods were, they werent my only weakness as a kid. When I wasnt fantasizing about grease, I was spending my young swishy days doing a really shitty job of hiding my insatiable hunger for other boys.","I was the kind of gay that doesnt go unnoticed. It wasnt until I escaped to college that I finally began to accept who and what I was. Once I did, I vowed to never let anyone make me feel like I was less than them simply because I lusted after and loved other men.","So you can imagine how upsetting it was for me when Chick-fil-As president, Dan Cathy, proudly came out as a homophobe in 2012 by claiming, We are inviting Gods judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage, and I pray Gods mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to define what marriage is about.","Even worse, the company put its money where Cathys vile mouth was by donatingmillions of dollars each year to anti-LGBTQ organizationsvia itsWinshape nonprofit organization.","As disappointed as I was to learn the chain I had loved as a child was working to make my life and the lives of my fellow queers a living hell, I was heartened by the swift response from the queer community and its supporters. For several years, the only time youd catch an LGBTQ person or an ally at Chick-fil-Awas for a protest.","And then ... something changed.","For some strange reason I still dont fully understand, some queer people and their friends and families began eating at Chick-fil-A again and are still eating there.","Id venture a guess that Cathyssomewhat conciliatory yet ridiculously inadequate non-apologyand the companys(totally bogus) promise to stop donating to anti-LGBTQ groups(while it may have ceased funding some groups, its certainly still bankrolling others) may have made some people feel justified in returning to the chain. People can be disturbingly indignant and defiant when faced with giving up their beloved chicken sandwiches.","When Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was called outearlier this week for tweeting about eating at Chick-fil-A during Pride Month, I was shocked to see how many queer people and their allies not only didnt care but went out of their way to defend the fast food chain.","Excuses Ive heard for continuing to eat at Chick-fil-A range from a nonchalant dismissal of the issue (In the grand scheme of things, eating there isnt really that big of a deal and we have bigger problems to worry about) to an all-or-nothing paradigm (I cant possibly avoid all of the problematic companies out there, so why should I worry about this one?) to a simple admission that the siren song of the companys kitchens has proven impossible to ignore (I know I shouldnt eat there but its justtoo goodnot to!).","To all of these flimsy justifications,I say, Bullshit. If you care about queer people  or you yourself are queer  you have absolutely no business eating at Chick-fil-A. Ever. Its really that straightforward.","If youre arguing there are other (arguably bigger) fish (or, in this case, chicken) to fry, you may not be wrong. However, I think youre underestimating my (and probably your) ability to be angry about  and take action against  more than one target at once. Just because Chick-fil-A may not be as bad (in your view) as the Trump administration (or countless other folks or corporations), that doesnt mean we shouldnt challenge Chick-fil-A on its anti-queer stance while continuing to call out and work against other offensive and/or dangerous entities.","Any effort or energy you dedicate to not filling Chick-fil-As queerphobic coffers does not compromise your ability to simultaneously do the same with other opponents. Surely, like me, you have enough  and are, sadly, constantly generating more outrage to spread around whenever and wherever it may be needed.","If youre arguing that virtually every company doing business today is problematic in one way or another, youre not wrong there either. (If you want to find other anti-queer culprits, check outthe Human Rights Campaigns Corporate Equality Index.) But when a corporation is wafting its anti-queer stance directly under your nose, as Chick-fil-A has and continues to do, not giving them more money to use against us is a no-brainer.","Im not saying that in order to be a good person or ensure you dont support despicable businesses, you have to hermetically seal yourself inside your home and only eat food youve hydroponically grown and only wear clothes youve woven on a loom built using recycled popsicle sticks and the stickier variety of bodily fluids you have handy. Im saying that when you know a company is anti-queer  and, whats more, when a company like Chick-fil-A goes out of its way to tell you as much  you shouldnt support them no matter how delicious a reason you can order up.","Yeah, I know, I know  it sucks that we cant have waffle fries. But you know what sucks even more? Not having equal rights and contributing to the profits of a company that wants to ensure you never do because it believes youre fundamentally disordered or unnatural or sinful or some delightful combination of all three.","Am I saying Chick-fil-A and everyone who works for it is evil? Of course not. The corporation hasdone a lot of goodand evendonated food to volunteers giving bloodin the wake of the Pulse nightclub massacre (though, ironically,most gay men werent allowed to participatein that charitable effort). But none of its generosity changes the fact that the chain has taken and continues to take an anti-queer stance andstill donates large sums of money to anti-queer groups.","Ultimately, if youre going out of your way to find a reason to continue to patronize Chick-fil-A, you might want to examine why you need to expend so much energy to do so.","No one likes to hear that theyre doing something wrong  or that they cant have something that brings them immense pleasure  but thats still exactly what Im telling you.","Its time to choose where your loyalties lie  with your community or with your stomach. Im hoping you can find another restaurant to satiate your chicken sandwich cravings. If all else fails, theres always this recipe to make acopycat version of the Chick-fil-A favoriteat home. Sure, it wont be exactly the same but its pretty damn close, and I promise itll go down a whole lot easier without all of that nasty queerphobia youve been ingesting.","MORE FROM HUFFPOST PERSONAL","MORE:","CONVERSATIONS"],"targetCaptions":[]}

This unprecedented level of worldwide interest in someone born seventh in line to the throne will, of course, only increase when the child arrives. And while he or she will be largely oblivious to their position for the first few years, teaching them how to manage the spotlight in the internet age will be just one of the things Harry and Meghan have to factor into their parenting.","Born into the worlds most famous royal family to parents who are two of its current stars, this childs life is not set up to be ordinary. However, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do want to give their son or daughter the chance to experience life outside the royal bubble. This is all the more important because their descendants are not destined for a future filled with royal duties and will instead be expected to carve out their own careers. In the same way that Prince Williams cousins are not full-time working royals, any children Harry has will fall too far down the pecking order to have their lives mapped out with a royal role.","Advertisement","This relative freedom is likely to excite Harry and Meghan who I expect will want their child to be exposed to lots of different opportunities so they can choose for themselves where they want to focus their attention. Harry was sporty as a child before thriving in the army and has championed sport and the military in his charitable work. Former actress Meghan found her love of acting growing up and took part in school plays before deciding to study theatre and international relations at university. Telling staff at Bristol Old Vic Theatre in February she thought creative arts and theatre were equally as important as sport in schools, it seems clear that Meghan will encourage any creative streak her child has.","The duchess also developed a strong interest in gender equality from an early age, successfully campaigning age 11 to change a sexist TV commercial. Palace aides have dismissed claims she will bring her child up gender fluid, but Meghan has made it clear that she wants to pass on her belief in equality amongst the sexes. During a panel discussion on International Womens Day, she said about a documentary she watched: One of the things they said during pregnancy was I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism. I loved that. So boy or girl or whatever it is, we hope that that's the case with our little bump.\"","Read next","Charles, William and Harry attend the premiere of Attenboroughs Our Planet","A royal night out","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Having started their married life in what is often described as the goldfish bowl of west Londons Kensington Palace, the Sussexs hope to be in Windsor by the time their child is born. With Frogmore Cottage undergoing large-scale structural renovations at the taxpayers expense (the couple will pay for their own fixtures and fittings) it is expected that they will make the property their home for several years. The idyllic, rural spot is just 25 miles from their new offices at Buckingham Palace but offers a completely different lifestyle to the intensity of the capital. With the 5,000-acre Windsor Great Park on their doorstep the family can enjoy the outdoors while still being a stones throw from Windsors many shops and cafes. However, if they want to be certain of avoiding attention from the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the picturesque town every year, they may choose to spend their down time behind closed doors. Close friends George and Amal Clooney, who have toddler twins, have a house 30 minutes drive from Frogmore Cottage in Sonning, and longtime confidante Elton John and his husband David Furnish have a house on the edge of the Great Park. The Queen and Prince Philip spend many weekends and every Easter at Windsor Castle. Cousins George, Charlotte and baby Louis will be natural playmates although the move away from Kensington Palace means that the cousins wont grow up constantly popping round to say hello.","Like William and Kate, Meghan and Harry want to play pivotal roles in their childrens lives rather than leave this to nannies. Meghans mum Doria, to whom she is very close and Harry has described as amazing, is expected to visit often and play a key role, although she will continue to live in Los Angeles. However, the couple will almost certainly get professional help, especially once they both resume royal duties. As well as potential nannies they may also choose to follow the Cambridges decision to send their child to a local nursery and will eventually have the pick of Windsors top schools.","Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie grew up in Windsor and both went to Upton House school, which takes girls and boys into the nursery from age two, followed by Coworth Park then St Georges School. Harrys old primary Ludgrove, which he attended from age eight, is a 30-minute drive away. His secondary school, Eton, is even closer at just a 20-minute walk from Windsor Castle. However, just as William and Kate have not chosen Williams old primary school for George, Harry and Meghan may also opt for somewhere completely different.","Even the future king is just called George by his teachers and classmates, and baby Sussex is sure to follow suit and be treated like everyone else in the classroom. What his or her title will be outside that is still to be determined. King George V limited titles within the royal family in 1917 meaning that the option of an HRH Prince or Princess would only be on the table if The Queen steps in and issues a Letters Patent. If Harry and Meghan dont want this, as the eldest son of a duke, a boy would inherit one of his fathers subsidiary titles and be called Earl of Dumbarton. A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor and any subsequent sons would be Lord (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.","Advertisement","Such things will be largely irrelevant when it comes to what sort of life this child will lead. It goes without saying that he or she will almost certainly never want for anything material. However, Harry and Megan - who was once a jobbing actress working to make ends meet - will be keen to make sure that their child is not spoiled or entitled.","It is pretty much impossible that this baby can ever inherit the throne - for example Prince Michael of Kent was born seventh in line and now at age 76 will become 48th after the birth of baby Sussex. That said, the sons of Princess Diana grew up side by side in the full - and equal - glare of the spotlight, meaning that the interest in Harry gives this family a unique place in the hearts and minds of many around the world.

In conjunction with Goldman Sachs and MasterCard, Apple will launch its new credit card this summer. It...","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Jennifer Bailey, vice president at Apple Inc., speaks during an event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S., on Monday, March 25, 2019. The company is unveiling streaming video and news subscriptions, key parts of Apple's push to transform itself into a leading digital services provider. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg","I watched the Apple special event today on my iPad. Much of the fanfare will fall on Apple Arcade, Apple TV+ and Apple News+. And then there was the surprise guest, Oprah Winfrey. For me, as an Apple shareholder, the big news was the new Apple credit card.","Apple partnered with Goldman Sachs and MasterCard to introduce the Apple Card. Available this summer, it will be a game changer.","Here's why.","Rewards","The cash back rewards of the Apple Card are best in class. Consumers will earn 3% cash back on purchases at Apple, 2% cash back on all other purchases using Apple Pay, and 1% cash back on purchases with the physical, titanium credit card. These rewards alone qualify the card as one of the best cash back credit cards available today. It competes head-to-head with the likes of the Citi Double Cash and Fidelity Visa cards.","Threefeatures of this rewards system stand out. The first is that the 2% cash back requires the use of Apple Pay. While Apple Pay has penetrated the U.S. retailing market, there are plenty of stores that still don't accept it. I know because it's annoying to waive my iPhone over the credit card device only to realize that I'm at a retailer that has yet to join the 21st century. If the demand for Apple Card is high, it could encourage more retailers to accept Apple Pay. And the 2% rewards will encourage more consumers to use it.","Second, the Apple Card pays out the cash back rewards daily. No longer do you need to wait to accrue a minimum amount of rewards or redeem them online. Cash back is added to your account daily. Called Daily Cash, it will be added to customers' Apple Cash card each day. It can be used for purchases using Apple Pay, to pay down the Apple Card balance, or even to send to friends via iMessage.","Finally, the 3% rewards apply not only to purchases at Apple stores, but also on the App Store and for Apple services. This should in turn drive more consumers to the Apple ecosystem.","Fees","In short, there are none. At least there are no fees that really matter. There is no annual fee, late fee, international fee, or over-the-limit fee. There's not even a penalty rate.","The App","As one would expect from Apple, the Apple Card app's simplicity is stunning. It clearly shows the card's balance, how many days until a payment is due, and daily and weekly spending activity by category. In this way, the app could function as a stand alone budgeting tool. With just a tap you can see your spending by color-coded category as well as your weekly and monthly total spending.","What caught my eye, however, is how it conveys payment and interest rate information to the consumer. The app will enable consumers to easily change their monthly payment amount to see how it will affect interest charges. As you slide the total payment higher, the app indicates how long it will take to pay off the balance given that payment amount. Consumers can then pay their monthly bill right from the app.","And speaking of payments, the Apple Card has finally done what I know many consumers want. Apple has made it easy to make multiple monthly payments in order to reduce interest charges.","The app will make it easier to understand the source of a purchase. Have you ever seen a credit card line item from a store you didn't recognize? As I record my spending in YNAB every week, I encounter this on a regular basis. With the iPhone location service, you can identify where a purchase occurred and the name of the store.","Finally, support is just a text message away.","It will be interesting to see how other credit card issuers respond. One thing is for sure. The combination of an excellent cash back card with the simplicity and functionality of the Apple Card app has the potential to change the industry in a way that's better for consumers.","Rob Berger is the Deputy Editor of Forbes Money Advisor and founder ofDoughroller.netand allcards.com.

He claimed that if his father had acted like Hillary Clinton, theyd be warming up the gas chamber. He tweeted an article warning that immigration in Europe would lead to a rape epidemic and another with a debunked rumor that Clinton used a secret earpiece during a presidential forum. He compared refugees to poisoned Skittles.","Trump claims innocence on some of these: He said he thought Pepe was just a funny frog in a wig, and that the gas chamber reference was to capital punishment, not the Holocaust. But he also hasnt apologized for giving offense. One gaffe like this is a mistake; two are careless; three start to look like a deliberate strategy.","Typically, candidates adult children dont play a big role in their campaigns, aside from the occasional speaking event. But Donald Trumps children with his first wife, Ivana Trump, have been unusually influential. Over the summer, Donald Trump Jr., his brother Eric Trump, and his sister Ivanka Trump helped force out former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and select Mike Pence as vice president. Donald Trump Jr. is often called a close political adviser.","Ivanka Trump is reaching toward the political left, signaling to the young career women who buy her clothes, read her books, and save her advice on Pinterest that she cares about the issues that matter to them. Her brother appears to be doing the same for the meme-slinging white supremacists known as the alt-right.","Whether Trump is doing this intentionally or through a level of carelessness that would be a crisis for any other campaign is, in a way, beside the point. More importantly, the Trump campaign has demonstrated repeatedly that it does not care whose voices it amplifies, as long as those voices are speaking up for Trump.","How Donald Trump Jr. went from rising political star to lightning rod","A friend sent me this. Apparently I made the cut as one of the Deplorables    All kidding aside I am honored to be grouped with the hard working men and women of this great nation that have supported @realdonaldtrump and know that he can fix the mess created by politicians in Washington. He's fighting for you and won't ever quit. Thanks for your trust!  #trump2016 #maga #makeamericagreatagain #basketofdeplorables","A photo posted by Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) on Sep 10, 2016 at 7:18pm PDT","Donald Trump Jr., the Republican nominees oldest son, looked like a politician in the making when he spoke at the Republican National Convention, fluently speaking the language of mainstream conservatives. Now hes mixing in another language entirely: references the far right is interpreting as a coded appeal.","A political star may have been born, Politicos Nick Gass and Ben Schreckinger wrote, calling Trumps speech powerful and rousing with widespread appeal. Unlike his father, Donald Jr., an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, spoke about conservative priorities fluently. He flirted with the possibility of a mayoral run.","His speech mixed anecdotes about his fathers roots in the construction business with a call for less regulation and more school choice, plus a forceful attack on Hillary Clinton. It was a speech that sounded like it could have been given at any Republican convention, not just Trumps  which means it stood out for its discipline and coherency.","But that was the high point of Trumps career as a surrogate for his father. When you look closer, he attracts endless controversy:","His latest tweet to provoke outrage compared refugees to poisoned Skittles  which, as the Trump campaign said in a statement, was just another way to frame Donald Trumps official policy.","The result of all of this has been to bring usually obscure figures, ideas, and memes to much more mainstream attention. As the Washington Post put it: A lot of Donald Trump Jr.s trail missteps seem to involve white nationalists and Nazis.","White supremacists are taking Trumps tweets as a coded signal","Whatever Trump meant by them, Pepe the Frog, the gas chambers remark, and the assumed endorsement of McDonald have all been effective dog whistles for the internet age.","YES: Donald Trump Jr. Makes Casual Joke About Gas Chambers! the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, enthused after his comments. This would mean that its a part of his normal speech pattern. I mean, this isnt a turn of phrase that normies use. But its the sort of metaphor that someone on the Alt-Right would use instinctively.","The article was illustrated with Pepe the Frog, inevitably. When Trump himself tweeted an image of Pepe in October 2015, it passed without notice  except by the Trump fans who created it, who celebrated the victory.","Pepe the Frog was a fairly mainstream meme on Tumblr in 2015, but this year its been used as a symbol by the online wing of the alt-right: internet trolls who love Donald Trump and live to provoke outrage by going against norms about political correctness or basic politeness. Jewish journalists who criticize Trump supporters are frequently met with a barrage of anti-Semitic images featuring Pepe.","The Deplorables meme that Donald Trump Jr. tweeted originated on 4chan, where the alt-right fans congregate, though it appears likely that Trump got it from Roger Stone, a conspiracy theorist and Trump surrogate. Stone tweeted the image  and Trump favorited his tweet  a few hours before Trump shared it on Instagram.","Trump says he had no idea who Pepe the Frog was before he tweeted the Deplorables meme: I thought it was a frog in a wig, he told Good Morning America. I thought it was funny.","Determining Trumps true intention is probably impossible. Given that millions of people who arent being attacked regularly by anti-Semites on Twitter have never heard of Pepe the Frog, thinking it was a frog in a wig might seem like a perfectly plausible explanation. On the other hand, its exactly this level of plausible deniability that makes a good dog whistle.","But Trumps intentions arent the only thing that matters. Its very bad if the campaign is reaching out to white supremacists and anti-Semites on purpose. But excusing this as ignorance isnt any better.","Trump seems to have gotten his habit of retweets from his father, the candidate; Donald Trump himself has displayed the same indifference to who his supporters are and what their other beliefs, besides Trump support, might be. The candidate tweeted an image widely seen as anti-Semitic that featured a Star of David and Hillary Clintons face on top of a pile of money, and then defended it with another meme borrowed from the alt-right. Hes retweeted white supremacists more than once, including one user whose Twitter handle was WhiteGenocideTM.","Hillary Clinton, in her speech on Trumps ties to the alt-right, said the candidate took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people, tying it to her message that Trump is temperamentally unfit for the presidency. This is not conservatism as we have known it, she said, making the case that Trump is outside the norm of the Republican Party.","By now, most campaigns  even those craven enough not to care about the moral implications of promoting racism  would understand that the failure to look into supporters backgrounds is a political liability. If Donald Trump Jr. cant be bothered to spend 30 seconds Googling the frog in a wig that he found in the Deplorables meme, that lack of curiosity is by now a deliberate choice from the entire campaign.","Message discipline is easy to mock. The calculated social media personas of most candidates and their families and advisers feel inauthentic. But theres also something honorable in acknowledging that power and influence should be used responsibly. If you can amplify a voice, you want to be sure its saying something you want the country to hear.","Next Up In\n    \n        Politics & Policy","Most Read","Vox Sentences","The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.","The Latest","Why Crazy Ex-Girlfriends series finale was so, so satisfying","Vox Sentences: A Saudi crackdown on womens rights","America is finally being exposed to the devastating reality of prison violence","Mark Halperin says his conduct has changed.

LGBTQ stance draws critics","targetDescription":"Maureen Groppe USA TODAY Published 5:24 PM EDT Mar 20, 2019 WASHINGTON Throughout most of his three decades in the public eye, Vice President Mike Pence...","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Welcome to USA TODAY NETWORKS EUROPEAN UNION EXPERIENCE","WASHINGTON Throughout most of his three decades in the public eye, Vice President Mike Pence has been the cordial conservative.","As a radio talk show host, he regularly brought on Democratic guests who knew they would get a respectful hearing.","As a conservative firebrand in the House, Pence had friendships across the aisle.","When, running for governor ofIndiana in 2012, Pence treated his Democratic opponent as if we were in a joint parade.","But now, one of Pences defining characteristics  of being nice  is under attack.","Vice President Joe Biden quickly backtracked after being lambasted by progressives and LGBTQ activists for calling Pence a decent guy this month.","That issue may become a litmus test for Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls with Sen. Elizabeth Warren being askedby a reporter in Iowa just days later if she agreed with Biden, according to the Des Moines Register.","\"You dont think the vice president is a decent man?\" the reporter asked.","\"No,\" Warren said.","Likewise,Montana Sen. Steve Bullock, who is considering running for president,was asked in Cedar Rapids this week if Pence is decent guy.","\"I don't know,\" he told NBC.","Even some members of his own party who have known Pence a long time have questioned how the Bible-studying Penceso easily aligned himself with a profane president who regularly calls people names and publicly mocks them.","But the current debate on the Democratic side stems from his record on LGBTQ matters  the issue that nearly ended Pences political career when, as governor, he signed into law a religious freedom bill that critics said was a license to discriminate against gay people.","More: What's funny about Mike Pence? He's 'the whitest person in politics'","Biden was criticizing President Donald Trumps record on foreign policy when, in a speech in Omaha, he characterized Pence as a decent guy.","Cynthia Nixon, an actor and advocate for progressive issues, chastised Biden on Twitter for calling Americas most anti-LGBT elected leader decent.","She followed up with a scathing opinion piece in the Washington Post headlined \"Mike Pence isnt 'decent.'Hes insidious.\"","\"The fact that Pence does vile, hateful things while well-coiffed and calm doesnt make him decent; it makes him insidious and dangerous,\" she wrote. \"Respecting each others rights and humanity is what makes us civilized  not keeping a civil tone while doing the opposite.\"","Some publications noted that Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is exploring a 2020 presidential bid, has also called Pence nice.","\"Pete Buttigieg called Mike Pence a 'super-nice'guy. Wheres the outrage?\"asked the online news magazine LGBTQ Nation.","Buttigieg, who devotes a chapter to Pence in his recently released memoir Shortest Way Home, distinguishes between Pences persona and his policies.","When Buttigieg, a member of the Naval Reserve, was deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 for example, a noticeably moved Pence called Buttigieg the day he was driving to the base.","Hes nice. If he were here, you would think hes a nice guy to your face, Buttigieg said on The Late Show recently when Stephen Colbert asked him if Pence is a good guy.","But hes also fanatical, Buttigieg added.","Not personally unkind to LGBTQ","In addition to his support for the religious freedom law that prompted a business backlash in the state, Pences record also includes advocating for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, opposing measures to protect gay menand lesbians from discrimination in the workplace, and opposing expanding the definition of hate crimes to cover offenses based on a victims sexual orientation or gender identity.","Recently, Pence has defended his wife against criticism for teaching at a Christian school that bans gay students and employees.","\"We will always defend the freedom of religion of every American of every faith, so help us God,\" Pence said at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week.","Pence is not known to be personally unkind to LGBTQ individuals. And after the 2016 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Pencecalled one of the leaders of Indiana's gay community to express his condolences and offerassistance.","On St. Patrick's Day, Pence hosted Leo Varadkar, the openly gay leaderof Ireland and his husband forbreakfast.","But advocates say what matters most is Pences policies, which they say dispute the right of LGBTQ people to exist.","When Biden backtracked, he tried to put the emphasis on Pences policies.","There is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President, he tweeted.","Pence hasnt publicly commented, but his spokeswoman tweeted recently a piece by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro saying Bidens response showed moral cowardice.","By casting all disagreement as hate-based and by destroying those with whom we disagree on a character level we worsen both hate and politics, Shapiro wrote. Its just fine for Joe Biden to think Mike Pence is a decent guy. And its pretty indecent to disagree.","Niceness 'weaponized as a tool'","One of Pences defining experiences was his unsuccessful run for Congress in 1990, a race considered among the most divisive and negative campaigns in Indiana history.","Mike told me it was his seminal political moment, Curt Smith, president of the Indiana Family Institute, told biographer Andrea Neal about the race and its aftermath. He said, 'You call people and they dont call you back, not because you lost but because they dont think youre a good guy.'He knew he had somehow crossed the line in political ambition.","When Pence turned to communicating his conservative view points as a radio talk show host, he vowed to make a distinction between differences in public policy and personal differences.","He regularly featured people with different opinions. One station even dropped Pences show when he refused to stop talking to the editor of the alternative Indianapolis paper.","My obligation first as a Christian is to try to respect that person, Pence said of why he tried to understand the perspective of callers and guests. If you cant disagree and maintain some civility, then forget democracy.","When, after he revived his dream of serving in Congress, Pence was unanimously elected in 2008 to be in charge of party messaging as chairman of the GOP conference, moderate Republicans were willing to back him because of his style, remembers former Rep. Mark Souder.","\"They said, 'Pence advocates views that are aligned with where the GOP is going, but hes not mean about it,'\"Souder said.","Friends and foes alike say Pences major character trait is extreme niceness, authors Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisnerwrote in a critical biography of Pence published last year.","But that niceness, they argue in The Shadow President, isnt passive. It'sweaponized as a tool of persuasion and deflection.","Now, whether Pence can even be called nice at all is being debated as his record on LGBTQ issues continues to draw headlines. When comedian John Oliver criticized that record last year by creating a parody version of a childrens book that Pences wife and daughter published about the familyrabbit, Charlotte Pence bought a copy of Olivers book.","My dad has always taught me to handle situations with grace, she told USA TODAY last year, just to be kind whenever you can."],"targetCaptions":[]}

James Gunn will, in fact, direct GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 3, after being removed from the project by his bosses at Walt Disney Studios after insensitive tweets were discovered on his feed.","Gunn posted a statement shortly after the news broke, tweeting:","Gunn said that while he made those jokes in the moment, he no longer was that immature person  and pointed out how much of the themes of the initial two GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY movies were about reconciling with your past, growing from your mistakes, finding friendship and forgiveness in loved ones, and working hard to make the universe a better place.","Disney removed him from the franchise anyway. That put the future of the Guardians in a serious state of limbo, as the cast defended Gunn  with Drax the Destroyer star Dave Bautista going so far as to say he no longer wanted to star in the sequel if James Gunn was not at the helm.","But Deadline, in its story about Gunn being reinstated as the director of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 3, said Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn met with Gunn repeatedly over the past few months and left convinced that Gunn was not the same person that tweeted those jokes years ago.","So, the Guardians will be able to complete their trilogy with the man who gave them their voice and their heart at the helm. The issue now, though, is when this movie will be in theatres. Its believed that Marvel Studios wanted GUARDIANS 3 to be its May 2020 release, kicking off the summer season (assumedly, after the Guardians come back from being dusted at the end of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR).","Production hasnt started on GUARDIANS 3, though, and in fact, James Gunn is on the hook to write and direct THE SUICIDE SQUAD for DC and Warner Bros., a project he accepted after Disney fired him.","So, we will get James Gunns GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 3, but its going to take longer than fans had likely hoped.

Mentoring a Colleague Could Help","targetDescription":"A study of police officers suggests mentoring can help mentors as well as mentees.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Your Cart","Executive Summary","Decades of research has demonstrated how junior employees benefit from being mentored. We know far less, however, about how mentoring might benefit mentors themselves. Researchers were interested in understanding how mentoring might help mentors who work in stressful occupations. They conducted a longitudinal study of a formal mentoring program in an English police force, and found that people who served as mentors experienced lower levels of anxiety, and described their job as more meaningful, than those who did not mentor. These mentors also said they found mentoring enhanced the meaningfulness of their work.","Decades of research has demonstrated how junior employees benefit from being mentored. Guidance from senior colleagues has also been shown to enhance mentees job performance and satisfaction. We know far less, however, about how mentoring might benefit mentors themselves.","We were interested in understanding how mentoring might help mentors who work in stressful occupations. Prior research has suggested that mentoring can improve the emotional health of mentees when a close, trusting relationship is established. We wondered if mentors would receive the same mental health benefits from the relationship.","Mental health is a serious and growing concern within occupations that play important social roles, such as medical professionals, firefighters, and police officers. And because policing is one of the most stressful occupations, with high levels of mental health and wellbeing difficulties, we conducted a longitudinal study of a formal mentoring program in an English police force.","The mentoring program was rolled out in 2013 in one of the police forces in England and Wales. It was designed to support the development of junior officers by giving them a way to discuss aspirations and concerns and receive guidance. Our study involved two parts. First, we conducted a field experiment: we compared the mental health of a treatment set of 17 mentor-mentee pairs that went through the mentoring program to a control group of 18 pairs of senior and junior officers that did not participate in the program. Second, we interviewed both the mentees and their mentors separately  18 participants with 35 formal interviews in total. We asked mentors and mentees about their stress levels, what they liked about their job, how they coped with stress, and whether their mentoring relationship helped them with this.","Our experiment results showed that people who served as mentors experienced lower levels of anxiety, and described their job as more meaningful, than those who did not mentor. We learned from our interviews that mentoring afforded senior officers, as well as junior officers, a venue for discussing and reflecting on concerns. Mentors heard their mentees accounts of anxiety and realized these feelings  which they also shared  were commonplace. By acknowledging that these anxieties were common, both mentees and mentors grew more comfortable in discussing them and in sharing different coping mechanisms. Mentors often found their interactions with junior colleagues therapeutic.","Many mentors we interviewed also said they found mentoring enhanced the meaningfulness of their work. Senior officers described feeling separated from the daily policing work of junior colleagues. They talked about how long-term project management and meetings often prevented them from doing what they described as real policing. This meant that they were less able to see their impact on peoples lives. But they could witness more direct and immediate results by helping the junior officers they mentored. For instance, one senior officer stated Doing this lets you do something important for someone and see the results fairly quick. You are helping them. They dont always listen, but it is satisfying. More than a lot of what I have to do these days. Another mentor noted how they were able to help their mentee navigate the process of taking on a new role and was able to see them thrive. This achievement helped him to realize how important his daily tasks were and how they could make a difference.","Why does mentoring have this impact on mentors? We believe it offers a way to receive support that is often lacking. Despite the pressures that comes with their roles  including abuse, difficult decision making, and the risk of death  police officers tend not to seek support from other officers, including more senior colleagues. This is to avoid negative stigma associated with mental health disorders. Mentoring thereby offered a way to build trust within a relationship that laid a foundation for open and honest communication of sensitive topics.","While our study relied on a small sample size and more work should be done on this subject, we believe that mentoring has the potential to support the mental health of mentors in other settings. Although the experience of being a police officer is distinct from many settings, the stigma surrounding mental health pervades many workplaces. There is also substantial evidence of effective mentoring generating trust between mentors and mentees, which supports the disclosure of personal information. As such, formal mentoring programs provide an opportunity to encourage the discussion of difficult and sensitive topics, which often remain undisclosed, and thereby normalize difficult experiences of stress and anxiety.","Of course, mentoring is an investment and the benefits are not always immediate. Work commitments can get in the way and prevent regular meetings, leaving some mentors and mentees unable to establish a personal connection, thus limiting the effect of mentoring on mental health. The mentors in our study said that the positive effect on anxiety, and the meaningfulness of their work, was reinforced as mentoring unfolded over time, through regular meetings with their mentees. As trust grew between them, so did the opportunities for sharing aspirations. By devising career and personal plans together and reviewing how they unfolded, the mentors and mentees interactions became increasingly valuable.","So if mentoring is to help mentors, organizations need to account for the resources allocated to mentoring and allow flexibility for those mentoring relationships to grow. Those that commit to mentoring might be surprised by the multidimensional benefits this practice brings.","Michael Gillis an Associate Professor in Organisation Studies at the Sad Business School and a Fellow of St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford.","Thomas Roulet is a Senior Lecturer in Organisation Theory at the Judge Business School and a Fellow of Girton College, both at the University of Cambridge.

Haffey / Getty Images","As the Los Angeles Lakers limped into the All-Star break, there was no use in sugarcoating reality: Just about everything that realistically could go wrong had gone wrong in the weeks prior.","LeBron James had suffered the lengthiest injury of his career, which kept him out five and a half weeks. The teams young players  vitally important to keep the club afloat in Jamess absence  had undoubtedly heard the swirling rumors about the Lakers willingness to part ways with everyone except James if it meant acquiring superstar Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans. Yet once it became clear that a Davis deal wasnt happening, it became easier to see the biggest problem: Los Angeles, which lost four of five heading into the break, wasnt finding ways to win and their chances of making the playoffs were edging from likely to unlikely. Heading into All-Star weekend, they stood at 40 percent.","There was still plenty of belief in the Lakers, though, if only because of James, and his legendary switch-flipping ability that wed seen so many times over the past few years. Its been activated, James said late last month of his playoff-level intensity.","But fast-forward to now, and all belief has ceased to exist. With Tuesdays loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, James and the Lakers have now dropped nine of their last 12 games, with their playoff probability dropping to a microscopic 2 percent in FiveThirtyEights projection model. As such, its almost certain that the banner franchise will extend its playoff drought to a sixth year (longest in team history), while James will fail to make the postseason for the first time since 2005.","How did things go off the rails so quickly and disastrously in Jamess first season out West?","Jamess injury  a possibility that shouldve been taken more seriously all along, given his age and the mileage on his tires  obviously was a killer. The Lakers were tied for fourth place at 19-14 on Christmas (when James was sidelined with the groin strain), then went just 6-11 without him.","Many other factors came into play, though.","The once-solid defense vanished.","Los Angeles ranked eighth in defensive efficiency as it closed out the month of January. That defense routinely gave the Lakers a fighting chance most nights even as the teams offense was still trying to develop a rhythm with James. But the defense has been nonexistent since the start of February, a span in which the Lakers have ranked dead last on that end of the floor.","Lonzo Balls absence has been a key factor here. He ranks sixth among point guards in ESPNs defensive real-plus minus, while veteran Rajon Rondo, who has played most of Balls missing minutes, ranks No. 62 in the same metric. The team has also suffered as Tyson Chandler  who gave the Lakers a boost when he first signed with them  hasnt been able to play nearly as much or as effectively because of a neck injury.","But lets be honest: Some of this boils down to sheer effort at times. LA ranked 11th at securing loose balls through the end of January, but since February sits just 21st in the same category. And while LeBron has put up numbers since his return, hes been part of the problem on D, where he often looks flat-out disinterested in closing out or making rotations.","The Lakers have had a ton of success on defense when theyre willing to work. They rank as the stingiest team in the NBA, allowing just 0.93 points per possession when they close out on jump-shooters, according to data from Second Spectrum. The effort to do so just hasnt been consistent enough.","They didnt take advantage of the NBAs worst teams.","The decreased hustle has doomed the Lakers lately in games against inferior competition where victories should have come easy. In the past month alone, theyve lost to Atlanta, the Pelicans without Anthony Davis, Memphis and Phoenix. (This season, theyve been beaten by five of the six NBA clubs that own sub-.400 records. The Chicago Bulls are the lone exception.)","Los Angeles currently sports a mediocre 16-13 record against teams under .500, a considerable contrast from Jamess last eight seasons in Cleveland and Miami.","LeBrons clubs usually dominate the NBAs bottom-feeders","Regular-season record against sub-.500 teams for teams led by LeBron James, since 2010","Record against teams under .500","season","team","Record","Win PERCENTAGE","2010","Miami Heat","37-5","88.0%","2011","Miami Heat","21-5","80.7","2012","Miami Heat","36-4","90.0","2013","Miami Heat","27-13","67.5","2014","Cleveland Cavaliers","30-14","68.1","2015","Cleveland Cavaliers","30-4","88.2","2016","Cleveland Cavaliers","29-6","82.8","2017","Cleveland Cavaliers","28-9","75.6","2018","Los Angeles Lakers*","16-13","55.1","* Through March 5","Source: ESPN","Winning some of those games might not have gotten the Lakers into the playoffs. But losing them makes it a little harder to argue that it was the steeper competition in the Western Conference that stopped James from reaching the playoffs.","It was the veterans who failed down the stretch.","It was fair to criticize the youngsters for awhile. Forwards Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram and guards Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart didnt play particularly well early on and really struggled during LeBrons absence, perhaps making it even more difficult to convince the Pelicans to make a deal with the Lakers.","But its hard to pin too much of this on Ball, whos been out with an injury. Kuzma hasnt shot well from deep this year at all, but hes still been a decent enough scorer. Ingram has played the best basketball of his life lately. The only young player whos really struggled is Hart, whose perimeter shooting has fallen off a cliff since the turn of the new year. (And even hes played better the past few games.)","If anything, a couple of the veterans who were brought in this summer have been to blame. Even after his 24-point showing Monday, Rondo has taken more shots than he has points over the past month and a half. And Lance Stephenson, when hes been able to play, has been even worse. The forward has shot just under 27 percent in the last two and a half weeks of February.","All offseason, critics wondered: Why are the Lakers targeting these free-agents, who dont come close to fitting the mold of the prototypical LeBron teammates? Which leads to the final critique ","This roster never made sense.","Some were bold enough early on to suggest that the Lakers didnt have a playoff roster. An abundant belief in LeBron, whod been to eight consecutive NBA Finals, undoubtedly masked the need for more reinforcements. But Magic Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka now have to shoulder the blame for not having a good enough contingency plan in place for if and when James got hurt.","Getting LeBron was fantastic  a coup of epic proportions. But entering the season without a bonafide second star to pair with James  who at 34 may be in perhaps the last true season of his prime, even  was tempting fate. Having that second fiddle couldve given the club enough to keep its head above water during LeBrons absence. Assuming that player would have been acquired before the season, at the expense of some of the Lakers young talent, its a safe bet that the Davis speculation that distracted the team midseason wouldnt have existed.","But setting aside the talk of what it wouldve meant to have a second star, what if Johnson and Pelinka had simply built the roster in the image of Jamess former teams? Instead of getting players who struggle to shoot, like Rondo and Stephenson, why not hold onto center Brook Lopez, who damn-near spaces the floor more on his own than the teams free-agent acquisitions combined?","It almost seems like the Lakers treated much of this season like an experiment. They got a chance to see how the youngsters looked alongside LeBron. They saw how Luke Walton handled the spotlight of coaching James and his new teammates.1 And they saw  in very awkward, hardball fashion  that other clubs wont just hand them stars to help build them into a superteam.","But hopefully, above all else, they learned that merely having James on the roster isnt enough to guarantee success. And that only figures to become more and more true as he gets older.","Footnotes","Its almost a given that Walton wont be back next year.","Chris Herring is a senior sportswriter for FiveThirtyEight.   @herring_nba","Comments","Filed under","NBA (630 posts)\nLeBron James (102)\nLos Angeles Lakers (36)\nLonzo Ball (6)\nRajon Rondo (3)\nWestern Conference (1)\nLuke Walton (0)","Most popular stories","When We Say 70 Percent, It Really Means 70 Percent","Willians Astudillo Is A Baseball Enigma","The Mueller Investigation Is Over, But Trumps Legal Problems Are Not","Interactives","Want more FiveThirtyEight?

","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Since the 1980s hundreds of phones featuring the likeness of our favourite Monday-hatin cat washed up in France and no one knew why.","Photo via Ar Viltansous Facebook page.","For years, France has had a Garfield problem.","Phones made in the likeness of everyones favourite Monday-hatin, lasagna-lovin cat would continually invade the shores of Brittany, a region in northwest France. Year in, year out, when people would set out to clean the glorious French beaches on the coast there would be our favourite orange feline staring up at them, mocking them with his cold dead eyes.","Since the 1980s, when Garfield-mania was really getting going, the phones have been coming in. And its not like theyre coming in at a small rate. According to FranceInfo, last year alone saw almost 200 of the phones wash up on the beaches.","It was like the ocean wanted to give the kind people of France a gift, and Poseidon just straight up loved kitschy shit from the 80s.","The phones are probably what you think of when you picture a novelty Garfield phone. They feature our lovely boy lounging on the ground and you lift the phone straight out of his back. To make it even more fun, the designers incorporated Garfields famous laziness, as his eyes only open when you pick up the phonepossibly out of the horror and pain which comes when you remove a portion of a creatures back. Now, the phones dont always come in whole-hog, sometimes you would just get Garfield's head, sometimes just his body or the phone from the back, or sometimes even just the cord but they would all be that familiar colour of orange.","The Garfield garbage was so ubiquitous in this area of France that some environmental groups started using him as almost a mascot to show how polluted our oceans were becoming.","As to where this pollution was coming from, well, there were a lot of theories of varying qualityI gotta assume at least one person thought that aliens dropped off these phones to fuck with residents. The prevailing wisdom was that the phones were leaking from a shipping container or ship that had sank, and over the years was slowly letting its cargo out. Claire Simonin-Le Meur, president of the environmental group Ar Viltanso, told the  Washington Post that if this was the case her group was worried the plastic from the phones would pollute the ocean. Her group therefore did whatever they could to find itincluding enlisting the help from gosh-darn submarines.","We were looking for it, but we had no precise idea of where it could be, Simonin-Le Meur said. We thought it was under the sea. We asked people who were divers to look for it. We get a lot of submarines in the area tooits a military area. But they said it was not possible the container could be there and nobody saw it.","Then last week, after some publicity around the mystery, a local farmer with a tale to tell found Simonin-Le Meur as she was cleaning up a beach. This farmer asked her if she was looking for Garfield, and when she replied yes, he told her, according to the  Washington Post, Come with me. I can show you.","The man told Simonin-Le Meur about a massive 1980s storm that ripped through the area and, out of the freakin blue, Garfield shit appeared fort the first time. The farmer and his brother were understandably curious at the phenomenon, and went exploring up and down the coast. As they did they came across a cave cut into the rocky shoreline. The two ventured inside and, lo and behold, dangerously deep in the bowels of the cave the brothers found a shipping container stuffed full of shit, including a massive amount of Garfield phones. Now, while sometimes accessible, this cave would be submerged during high tide, which is when the Garfield phones would leak out. He showed Simonin-Le Meur the cave but sadly it was high tide and the two couldnt go in.","Not to be deterred, Simonin-Le Meur got herself a team together, invited some journalists, and when the tide was low they went searching for the shipping container. It wasnt long until they found it. Sadly, while they won the battle, it seems they had lost the war, as the Garfield phones were almost entirely gone, taken by the sea.","I saw Garfield and container pieces all over the cave, Simonin-Le Meur said to  Le Monde. But the bulk of the phones are already gone, the sea has done its job for thirty years.","So, out there in the tides are Garfield phones floating around waiting for their turn to wash up on the shoreline. While we now know where they came from, we cant stop the inevitable Garfield invasion of France.","Just goes to show you cant keep a good cat down.","Sign up for the VICE Canada Newsletter   to get the best of VICE Canada delivered to your inbox.","Follow Mack Lamoureux on  Twitter .","VICE Canada has a Newsletter.","Sign up now to get the best of VICE Canada delivered straight to your inbox"],"targetCaptions":[]}

And who's among the Fallen? #AvengeTheFallen posters reveal answers to questions we've asked for a year. ","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["News","Who Survived? And who's among the Fallen? #AvengeTheFallen posters reveal answers to questions we've asked for a year.","One month remains until audiences will learn how the Avengers take back their universe in Avengers: Endgame. And as the smart minds at Marvel Studios know how to capitalize on a moment like that, they released an overwhelming amount of character posters Tuesday tallying the living and the dead. Although we imagine showing the work of Thanoss (Josh Brolin) grim calculus was not their primary goal, the release clearly lays out who among the sprawling Marvel family still breathes air going into Endgame. Lets take a look at who disappeared, who faced the horror, and who might still be unaccounted for.","The Fallen: Posters Confirm Shuri Did Not Survive the Snap","With the posters featuring lost characters in black and white, Marvel introduces a new term for those lost moments after the Snap  the Fallen. Its a handy term, if one often used in supernatural films and television shows to categorize those who went to war against Heaven. But within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it boils down a mouthful into one word.","The Fallen include headliners like Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) andDoctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), supporting characters like Bucky (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the entire Pym/Van Dyne family, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Additionally, all of the Guardians of the Galaxy except Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) were also lost in the Snap.","The Fallen also includes three people featured on the new character posters who fell prior to Thanoss quick-fingered coup de grace: Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Gamora (Zoe Saldana). The latters death was always significant as Thanos threw her off a cliff to get the Soul Stone  and presumably she will haunt him on his garden planet. Lokis death, however, felt far from final as he cheats death all the time. Maybe he will be the first of the Fallen (heh) to return. And Vision? Well, he is going to be part of that Disney+ limited series with Scarlet Witch, so his resurrection also seems assured.","The list of the Fallen has remained pretty consistent since last Spring, but the character posters finally confirmed Shuri (Letitia Wright) went into the dust with her brother. Many suspected this was the case when her photo appeared in a blink-and-youll-miss-it moment in the first Endgame trailer, leading to months of speculation. But with the poster, her death is confirmed. We imagine fans will need some time to process this.","The Survivors: Valkyrie, Pepper Confirmed Survivors","By keeping the Fallen in black and white and the survivors in color, Marvel also confirmed a handful of characters whose status was unknown until Tuesday. Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Wong (Benedict Wong), Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) all survived the Snap. They join Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket, War Machine (Don Cheadle), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) as those facing a universe with such terrible losses and determining a way to undo Thanoss ultimate act.","When we last saw Wong, he was headed back to the Sanctum Sanctorum to defend it should any members of the Black Order head there. Over the past year, weve joked that he made the smartest choice by high-tailing it out of the movie and it seems his decision proved to be a wise one. It remains to be seen how the Avengers may approach Wong or how his understanding of the mystic arts will aid them, but its safe to presume the survivors will tackle the Thanos problem from all angles  including ones they may have previously dismissed as so much hokum.","Valkyrie, meanwhile, adds another number to the powerhouse squad with Thor, Carol, and the Hulk (should he decide to come out of hiding). When we last saw her, she was with Thor aboard the Asgardian refugee ship. Since she managed to survive both Thanoss attack on the vessel and the Snap, were going to assume she helped the few remaining Asgardians  there are a few left, right?  find shelter. If that mission is complete, it is likely she will join Thor in a search for a solution. Or, knowing her, she took it upon herself to figure out some way of revenging after a few stiff drinks.","Also, we imagine the already burgeoning corps of Valkyrie/Carol shippers are quaking at the possibility the two will share some screen time in Endgame.","Considering Favreaus decision to leave the creative aspects of the Marvel Universe behind, it is always nice to see Happy survive where other support characters have literally bitten the dust. Then again, we knew his long-term survival was assured thanks to his appearance in the Spider-Man: Far From Home trailer. But since were assuming most of the Fallen will return during the events of Endgame, it was only a question of whether or not he was lost in the Snap. And while everyone assumed Peppers survival because of Tonys message to her in both Endgame trailers, the poster is proof positive she is alive. You can bet she will pour as much of Stark Industries resources as she can muster into rebuilding the world and helping the Avengers.","Others Whose Fates Are Still Unknown","The posters also offer a reliable guess as to who among the Fallen we might see in Endgame  a Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) poster certainly suggests she will appear  but there are a few characters who are notable by their absence on posters and their still unknown status going into Endgame.","As we always thought it was possible for Luis (Michael Pea) to knock out Thanos with one punch, his status intrigues us the most. Although, he is just one member of the Ant-Man family we want clarification on. Did Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) survive? Considering online rumors insist an older, time-traveling Cassie will feature in Endgame, keeping her fate obscured may be part of Marvels plan. And what of Maggie (Judy Greer), Paxton (Bobby Cannavale), Kurt (David Dastmalchian), Dr. Foster (Laurence Fishburne), and Ava (Hannah John-Kamen)? Sure, they may not factor intoEndgame beyond motivating Scott to make for the Avengers HQ, but clarity is always appreciated.","Others unaccounted for include General Ross (William Hurt), Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Peters classmates, Maria and Monica Rambeau (Lashana Lynch and Akira Akbar), and Howard the Duck.","Of course, it still remains to be seen how the survivors will avenge the Fallen.

It has been an honour to play a leading role in progress that has shaped our country: bringing Syrian refugees to Canada; legislating a balanced approach to Medical Assistance in Dying; negotiating a health accord with new resources for mental health and home care; improving infrastructure for First Nations to provide clean water on reserve; and reforming child welfare to reduce the over-apprehension of Indigenous children.","However, I have been considering the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks and after serious reflection, I have concluded that I must resign as a member of Cabinet.","In Canada, the constitutional convention of Cabinet solidarity means, among other things, that ministers are expected to defend all Cabinet decisions. A minister must always be prepared to defend other ministers publicly, and must speak in support of the government and its policies. Given this convention and the current circumstances, it is untenable for me to continue to serve as a Cabinet minister.","Unfortunately, the evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former Attorney General to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin, and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me. Those concerns have been augmented by the views expressed by my constituents and other Canadians.","The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system. It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases. Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.","It grieves me to leave a portfolio where I was at work to deliver on an important mandate. But I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on ones principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.","Although I must regretfully resign from Cabinet, I will continue to serve Canadians in every other way that I can. I was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Markham-Stouffville and I intend to continue in that role. I am firmly committed to our crucial platform priorities, especially: justice for Indigenous peoples; and implementing a plan to tackle the existential threat of climate change. Canadians need the assurance that, in all matters, Members of Parliament will act in the best interests of the public. My decision has been made with that spirit and intent.","Sincerely,","The Honourable Jane Philpott MD PC MP","Member of Parliament for Markham-Stouffville","Related Stories","Related Links","Photos","Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott speaks at the Assembly of First Nations Special Chiefs meeting in Ottawa, Wednesday, December 5, 2018.

With all of that in mind, Zack Snyder would like everyone to make their peace with the fact that the DCEUs Batman has killed people, and nothing short of a universe-altering turn of events is going change that.","While answering audience questions about Watchmen during a recent event (that was filmed andposted to Reddit), Snyder described how fans still come up to him with gripes about the dark tone of his DC superhero movies, and the fact that both Batman and Superman have killed people. While Snyder understands where peoples objections come from, he added that he really wishes everyone would wake the fuck up and move on already:","Once youve lost your virginity to this fucking movie and then you come and say to me something about like my superhero wouldnt do that. Im like Are you serious? Im like down the fucking road on that.","Its a cool point of view to be like my heroes are still innocent. My heroes didnt fucking lie to America. My heroes didnt embezzle money from their corporations. My heroes didnt commit any atrocities. Thats cool. But youre living in a fucking dream world.","Advertisement","Regardless of how you feel about Snyders films, the director has a point, given that, on the whole, studios tend to skew more realistic with their live-action adaptations of comic books. That means that certain characters like Batman whove always been rather brutal fighters might end up killing people depending on how a film or show plays out. Even if there isnt something as jarring as seeing Batman let a bunch of people get hit by a car, the chaos and destruction thats featured in these movies results in hundreds if not thousands of people (human or otherwise) dying, and so the point is rather moot.","Sure, Batman doesnt kill in the comics, and thats all very nicebut nitpicking about him killing in the films is literally one of the least interesting things to waste your time doing.","[h/t CBR]","For more, make sure youre following us on our new Instagram @io9dotcom.","Advertisement","Share This Story","More Zack Snyder Stories","Zack Snyder's Next Movie Will Be an 'Epic and Crazy' Zombie Heist for Netflix [Updated]","For better or worse, Man Of Steel is the exact Superman movie Zack Snyder wanted to make","Directors' Cuts Won't Save You","People are Asking AT&T Customer Service to Release the Snyder Cut of Justice League","This Is the Picture That Proved Henry Cavill Could Be Superman","Apparently the Zack Snyder Justice League Cut Fans Have Been Petitioning for Doesn't Exist","About the author","io9 staff writer.

I have nothing to do with this man, other than that I passively received a donation from him.\"","Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has said the group will be dissolved if it is deemed to be a terrorist organisation.","\"There must be no tolerance for dangerous ideologies in our country - no matter if it's radical Islam or right-wing fanaticism,\" he said.","The main suspect in the Christchurch mosque attacks, Australian Brenton Tarrant, also seems to have had a preoccupation with Austrian history - something the interior minister said was being investigated.","Austrian landmark","The suspect's clothes and weapons were covered with writing and symbols.","One of the words daubed in white on a gun magazine was \"Vienna\".","There was also a string of names of historical figures, including that of Count Ernst Rdiger von Starhemberg, the military commander of Vienna during the Ottoman siege of 1683.","Starhemberg and his company of 20,000 men defended the city against the 120,000-strong Ottoman army, which was eventually defeated by the combined forces of Poles, Habsburgs and the Holy Roman Empire.","The Battle of Vienna in 1683 is often cited by historians as the point where the Ottoman advance on Western Europe was stopped; the turning of the tide in the Muslim/Christian struggle for the control of Europe.","As such, it is a date celebrated by the far right, including, it seems, the Christchurch suspect, who is a self-confessed anti-Muslim white supremacist.","'The Great Replacement'","The Documentation Archive of the Austrian Resistance (DOEW), which researches extreme-right activity, says there are \"many rhetorical and ideological overlaps\" between groups like the Identitarians and the suspected Christchurch attacker.","\"The title of the attacker's manifesto, The Great Replacement (which sees immigrants as a threat to \"white\" Western culture) was a slogan popularised by the Identitarians,\" DOEW said on its website.","\"Regardless of the outcome of the investigation,\" DOEW says, the Identitarians seem to be sticking to their narrative \"for the time being\". It points to an IB statement from last week, which speaks of the \"Great Replacement\" and calls for \"De-Islamification\".","The whole affair is uncomfortable not just for the Identitarians, but for Austria's government as well.","Mr Kurz's own conservative Austrian People's Party is in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FP), making Austria the only country in Western Europe with a far-right presence in government.","FP leader and Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache said on Wednesday that his party had \"nothing to do with the Identitarians\".","However, Austrian media published photos of FP politicians with members of the group, and Bernhard Weidinger from DOEW told the BBC that there were many links between FP politicians and members of the IB, who often attended each other's events.","In 2016, before he became interior minister, Herbert Kickl gave a speech to a far-right conference in Linz, called Defenders of Europe. The FP politician addressed his audience, which included Identitarians, as \"like-minded people\", according to Austrian media reports.","The FP has also long celebrated the Battle of Vienna victory of 1683. In 2010 it even published a comic, set during the siege, featuring Mr Strache as a knight saving Vienna's cathedral from an Ottoman minaret.","And when Mr Strache and Mr Kurz presented their government programme back in 2017, shortly before the coalition was sworn in, they broke with tradition, and held the event on Vienna's Kahlenberg mountain, where the Battle of Vienna took place.","Asked if there was any historical significance to the choice of venue, Mr Kurz said no.","But in a video blog, Mr Sellner hailed it as \"a good omen\".","Related Topics","Share this story        Aboutsharing","More on this story","Top Stories","The chancellor believes an agreement can be reached with Labour despite no talks planned this weekend.","Features","The NFL star abandoned on London's streets","Unforgettable TV - Our Planet, Attenboroughs Netflix debut","The treasure hunt that gripped a nation","How did the Kardashians make their millions?","The women divided by Brexit","Israel election: Who are the key candidates?","The 'womanspreading' placard that caused fury in Pakistan","Secrets of Race Across the World","How Algeria's army sacrificed a president to keep power","Elsewhere on the BBC","Legendary live gigs","Five life-changing concerts from the music world","Daily news briefing direct to your inbox","Sign up for our newsletter","BBC News Navigation","BBC News Services","Explore the BBC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Meyer/Bay Area News Group)","CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device","OAKLAND  The Warriors are poised to add another league MVP to play alongside Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry this season.","Though, I should clarify, its the MVP of the National Basketball League.","The Warriors are engaged in negotiations to sign former Dub Andrew Bogut to a contract that will last the remainder of the season. The 7-foot Australian  who won a title with the Warriors in 2015  will need to obtain a work visa and receive FIBA clearance to come back stateside after an MVP campaign in Australias professional league, per ESPN, but there are no issues expected on that front.","So why are the Warriors bringing back Bogut?","Its simple: hes DeMarcus Cousins insurance.","Until Bogut signs, the Warriors will have one center, Cousins, on the roster, and given the glut of imposing big men in the Western Conference  Oklahoma Citys Steven Adams, Utahs Rudy Gobert, Denvers Nik Jokic, and Portlands Jusuf Nurkic stand out  that was not a solid situation heading into the postseason.","Yes, Golden State has played Draymond Green, Kevon Looney, and Jordan Bell at the five this season, but the way the coaching staff sees it, all three of those players are forwards.","And with Cousins up-and-down play, Greens injury history, Bells inconsistency and size, and Looneys pelvis inflammation, the Warriors needed to add a defensively-minded big man to the roster.","Bogut is unquestionably that.","The big man looks spry compared to the last time we saw him in the NBA, though that might be attributed to him being a big fish in a small pond in Australia.","So how much playing time will Bogut get with the Warriors? That depends on Cousins, who has not fixed all thats ailed the Warriors since hitting the floor in January.","Dont get me wrong, Boogie has been a welcome addition to the Warriors and is showing clear improvement daily, but his defense has been lackluster (thats the nice way to put it)  even with his 20-point performances of late, hes giving up as much hes getting and theres been little evidence that the paradigm will shift in the Warriors final 19 regular-season games.","The Warriors couldnt enter the playoffs with wishful thinking as a Plan B at C. Hopes and dreams dont win titles.","Excellent defense to go with strong offense, on the other hand, does, and Bogut is a step in the right direction for the Warriors, who rank 16th in the NBA in defensive rating this season and were unlikely to improve much with Cousins playing 25-plus minutes a night without a true backup. Its been 18 years since a team with a defensive rating that low won a title.","While Bogut is also susceptible in pick-and-roll defense, should Cousins find himself in foul trouble  something thats likely to happen considering his defensive footwork and teams increasing propensity to target him  the Warriors can now feel that they wont get pushed around on the block, lose rim protection, or put Green in a precarious spot for extended time.","And offensively, Bogut is an exceptional screener and passer through whom the Warriors can run some offense through the high post he doesnt have a jump shot like Cousins, but he knows how to make sure that the Warriors have pace and flow in the offense.","Ultimately, there will likely be nights that Bogut doesnt play at all, and so long as thats not an issue for him, that wont be an indictment on this acquisition for the Warriors. The teams goal was to have a viable backup center off the bench  the playoffs are dictated by matchups and there, options are power.","It should also be noted that this years buyout market didnt give the Warriors much to choose from at their two biggest needs  backup center and 3-point shooting wing.","Wesley Matthews, who was bought out by New York after he was part of the Kristaps Porzingis trade between the Knicks and Mavericks, would have been an excellent wing fit for the Warriors, but he signed with the Pacers, where hes playing more than 30 minutes per game.","And outside of the undesirable Marcin Gortat, there werent NBA-quality centers available to sign on the buyout market.","Thats why signing Bogut out of Australia looks like such a clever move for the Warriors. Because Bogut hasnt played in the NBA this season, hes not subject to those buyout market rules  despite being signed after March 1, he can play in the postseason.","And adding a player the veteran players are familiar with should spark an air of positivity around a team thats frankly going through the regular-season motions now that Boogies new-player smell has faded.","That said, it was a bit surprising that the Warriors and Bogut were able to come to an agreement. Bogut had an up-and-down 2016 year which frayed the relationship between him and the team, leading to his trade to Dallas after the season as part of the Warriors salary-cap maneuvering to sign Kevin Durant.","Now, the Warriors will have both him and Durant  at least for the next few months.","Adding Bogut will fill out the Warriors roster at 15 players, though there remains the possibility that Golden State can add a 3-point shooting wing ahead of the start of the postseason.","Two-way player Damion Lee has performed well in spot minutes this season and his strong game against Philadelphia on Saturday opened eyes  he could be added to the roster in the coming weeks, though that would require the Warriors to cut a player. The top candidates to be jettisoned come from a pool of players whose contracts expire the end of the season or do not have guaranteed money for next year  Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, Jonas Jerebko, and Bell  though theres no indication that the Warriors plan on making such a move at the moment.","For now, Bogut will absolutely do.","Dieter Kurtenbach","Get Morning Report and other email newsletters","Most Popular","More in Golden State Warriors","Warriors Stephen Curry achieved another milestone","Warriors 120; Cavaliers 114: Warriors showing varying progress with playoff preparation","Warriors DeMarcus Cousins reflects on his journey in Showtime film","Warriors Quinn Cook likely to have significant bench role in playoffs"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The presidents description of it as a witch hunt was accurate.","I regularly acknowledged that I was putting my credibility on the line by stating that it was all a hoax. But how did I know that? After all, I wasnt privy to any confidential intelligence.","One answer is I used common sense. The Trump-Russia collusion charge and the Donald-Trump-is-an-agent-of-the-Kremlin charge struck me  and tens of millions of other Americans  as absurd. Vladimir Putins influence on the 2016 election was negligible, and as president, Trump has been harder on Russia  in supporting Ukraines anti-Russian government, in fighting Syrias pro-Russian government and in confronting Irans pro-Russian regime  than Barack Obama was.","But the biggest reason I never believed the Russian collusion charge was that the charge emanated from the left. And the left lies about everything. Truth is a liberal value, and truth is a conservative value, but it has never been a left-wing value. People on the left say whatever advances their immediate agenda. Power is their moral lodestar; therefore, truth is always subservient to it.","The left wanted to undo the 2016 presidential election from the day Trump won. So they made up the Russian collusion story. This was obvious to every conservative  except for Never Trumpers, who, with regard to Trump, have been indistinguishable from the left and were therefore as prepared as any leftist to believe the Trump-Russia collusion tale. We conservatives knew that a) the left wanted to invalidate the election and b) the left lies when it is in their interest to do so. So we knew the collusion charge was a fabrication.","We also suspected that the collusion hoax may well have been an effort to divert attention from the real crimes here: American intelligence agencies being used to spy on a presidential candidate for the first time in American history; getting Clinton off the hook for her illegal use of a private server while secretary of state; her use of that office to enrich herself and her husband; and her destruction of the evidence once her hidden emails were subpoenaed.","If you always doubt a leftist claim, you will almost always be closer to the truth. I employed that rule in concluding the collusion story was a fraud, and it served me well.","Name the issue and you will likely find a left-wing lie. The left claims our universities are saturated by a culture of rape. Not only is that a lie, but deep down, leftists know its a lie. The proof? Every left-wing parent who speaks about the culture of rape on college campuses sends his or her daughter to college. As no parents would ever send their daughter to an actual rape culture, left-wing parents who send their daughters to college know it is not really a rape culture. They say it is a rape culture solely to buttress the feminist argument that American males are misogynists and to provide young women with the highest status in the left-wing value system: victim.","Although I havent been a student or taught at a college in many decades, thats how I knew American colleges were not rape cultures. I knew it because the left said they were. Again, just assume the left is lying and you will be close to arriving at the truth.","How do I know there are only two sexes? The most obvious reason is, again, common sense. But the second most powerful reason is the left denies there are only two sexes and claims there is no such thing as sex, only subjective gender. Last week, a writer for the left-wing magazine The Nation defended the victory of two high school male-bodied trans women who defeated all the female-bodied women in a Connecticut track competition  because, in his words, trans women are in fact women.","Now, we all know trans women are not in fact women, that they are biologically men who regard themselves as women. And in private life, I have no problem treating trans women as women if they look and dress female and take on a female name. But it is completely unjust to have them compete against born females in sports. They are not in fact women; they consider themselves women despite the facts. Again, assuming the left is lying to advance its agenda leads one to truth.","When the left tells us the Earth has 12 years left because of global warming, I assume they are not telling the truth. One bit of proof is that almost no one on the global-warming-will-destroy-life left advocates the safest, cheapest and most practical non-fossil-based source of energy: nuclear power. If they really believed life was existentially threatened by fossil-based fuel, they would be building nuclear reactors as fast they could make them. One reason I havent believed man-made global warming will destroy the Earth is that the left does.","So, while the latest left-wing lie  Trump-Russia collusion  is now exposed, there is little to cheer about. Without missing a beat, the left  the Democratic Party, the media and academia  will move on to another lie.","And there will be no soul-searching on the part of the media or the rest of the left.","Why wont there be? Because no leftist acknowledges the collusion story was a lie.","Truth has never been a left-wing value. Like gender, it is whatever you want it to be.","Dennis Prager is a nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist.

All-powerful. All-knowing. The idea of the deity most Westerners accept is actually not coherent.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Opinion","Perfect. All-powerful. All-knowing. The idea of the deity most Westerners accept is actually not coherent.","CreditCreditReuters","Supported by","By Peter Atterton","Mr. Atterton is a professor of philosophy.","If you look up God in a dictionary, the first entry you will find will be something along the lines of a being believed to be the infinitely perfect, wise and powerful creator and ruler of the universe. Certainly, if applied to non-Western contexts, the definition would be puzzling, but in a Western context this is how philosophers have traditionally understood God. In fact, this conception of God is sometimes known as the God of the Philosophers.","As a philosopher myself, Id like to focus on a specific question: Does the idea of a morally perfect, all-powerful, all-knowing God make sense? Does it hold together when we examine it logically?","Lets first consider the attribute of omnipotence.","Youve probably heard the paradox of the stone before: Can God create a stone that cannot be lifted? If God can create such a stone, then He is not all powerful, since He Himself cannot lift it. On the other hand, if He cannot create a stone that cannot be lifted, then He is not all powerful, since He cannot create the unliftable stone. Either way, God is not all powerful.","The way out of this dilemma is usually to argue, as Saint Thomas Aquinas did, that God cannot do self-contradictory things. Thus, God cannot lift what is by definition unliftable, just as He cannot create a square circle or get divorced (since He is not married). God can only do that which is logically possible.","Not all philosophers agree with Aquinas. Ren Descartes, for example, believed that God could do absolutely anything, even the logically impossible, such as draw a round square. But even if we accept, for the sake of argument, Aquinas explanation, there are other problems to contend with. For example, can God create a world in which evil does not exist? This does appear to be logically possible. Presumably God could have created such a world without contradiction. It evidently would be a world very different from the one we currently inhabit, but a possible world all the same. Indeed, if God is morally perfect, it is difficult to see why he wouldnt have created such a world. So why didnt He?","The standard defense is that evil is necessary for free will. According to the well-known Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga, To create creatures capable of moral good, [God] must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He cant give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so. However, this does not explain so-called physical evil (suffering) caused by nonhuman causes (famines, earthquakes, etc.). Nor does it explain, as Charles Darwin noticed, why there should be so much pain and suffering among the animal kingdom: A being so powerful and so full of knowledge as a God who could create the universe, is to our finite minds omnipotent and omniscient, and it revolts our understanding to suppose that his benevolence is not unbounded, for what advantage can there be in the sufferings of millions of the lower animals throughout almost endless time?","What about Gods infinite knowledge  His omniscience? Philosophically, this presents us with no less of a conundrum. Leaving aside the highly implausible idea that God knows all the facts in the universe, no matter how trivial or useless (Saint Jerome thought it was beneath the dignity of God to concern Himself with such base questions as how many fleas are born or die every moment), if God knows all there is to know, then He knows at least as much as we know. But if He knows what we know, then this would appear to detract from His perfection. Why?","There are some things that we know that, if they were also known to God, would automatically make Him a sinner, which of course is in contradiction with the concept of God. As the late American philosopher Michael Martin has already pointed out, if God knows all that is knowable, then God must know things that we do, like lust and envy. But one cannot know lust and envy unless one has experienced them. But to have had feelings of lust and envy is to have sinned, in which case God cannot be morally perfect.","What about malice? Could God know what malice is like and still retain His divine goodness? The 19-century German pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer was perhaps the first philosopher to draw attention to what he called the diabolical in his work On Human Nature:","For man is the only animal which causes pain to others without any further purpose than just to cause it. Other animals never do it except to satisfy their hunger, or in the rage of combat . No animal ever torments another for the mere purpose of tormenting, but man does it, and it is this that constitutes the diabolical feature in his character which is so much worse than the merely animal.","It might be argued, of course, that this is precisely what distinguishes humans from God. Human beings are inherently sinful whereas God is morally perfect. But if God knows everything, then God must know at least as much as human beings do. And if human beings know what it is like to want to inflict pain on others for pleasures sake, without any other benefit, then so does God. But to say that God knows what it is like to want to inflict pain on others is to say that God is capable of malicious enjoyment.","However, this cannot be true if it really is the case that God is morally perfect. A morally perfect being would never get enjoyment from causing pain to others. Therefore, God doesnt know what it is like to be human. In that case He doesnt know what we know. But if God doesnt know what we know, God is not all knowing, and the concept of God is contradictory. God cannot be both omniscient and morally perfect. Hence, God could not exist.","(I shall here ignore the argument that God knows what it is like to be human through Christ, because the doctrine of the Incarnation presents us with its own formidable difficulties: Was Christ really and fully human? Did he have sinful desires that he was required to overcome when tempted by the devil? Can God die?)","It is logical inconsistencies like these that led the 17th-century French theologian Blaise Pascal to reject reason as a basis for faith and return to the Bible and revelation. It is said that when Pascal died his servant found sewn into his jacket the words: God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob  not of the philosophers and scholars. Evidently, Pascal considered there was more wisdom in biblical revelation than in any philosophical demonstration of Gods existence and nature  or plain lack thereof.","Peter Atterton is a professor of philosophy at San Diego State University.","Now in print: Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments, and The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments, with essays from the series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.","The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

That's all you have to do when taking a gene test by the companies 23andMe and AncestryDNA. Health information is a major reason for the rapid growth in gene testing. But watch out: When the DNA report comes back, everything you think you know about yourself and your family can change in an instant.","Katy Canning never exactly looked like her parents. \"My mom would tell me when I was growing up, 'Oh, you're part Native American. You're Native American,'\" she told correspondent Tony Dokoupil.","But when she finally took an at-home DNA test about five years ago, she got a lot more truth than she expected. She's part Jamaican, for starters, and her biological father is not the man who raised her, but a traveling guitarist named Baron Duncan.","\"It is crazy, so crazy,\" Canning said.","And the revelations kept coming, as Canning learned that Baron Duncan had at least four other children, her half-siblings.","\"You grew up thinking that you were the oldest of two, and in fact you are the oldest of five?\" asked Dokoupil.","\"Exactly.\"","\"Do they look like you?\"","\"So much!\" Canning said. \"Meeting my brother Stephen for the first time, it was like looking at my twin. I literally started crying as soon as I saw him.\"","Canning is one of millions who have turned to home DNA tests, and one of many who have had their sense of identity shaken by the results.","23andMe and AncestryDNA both warn customers they could receive shocking information, but neither company offers genetic counseling as part of their standard package.","\"People are smart enough and capable, they can make sense of it,\" said Emily Drabant Conley, vice president of business development at 23andMe. She believes customers can handle genetic information, just as they do the results of other at-home exams.","\"People take a pregnancy test at home and if it's positive, which is significant information, they then take the next step of talking to a doctor, and we think that DNA tests are very much in the same vein,\" Conley said.","AncestryDNA says it takes \"the potential impact of complex discoveries  very seriously,\" and has a team available for people with \"more sensitive queries.\"","But DNA tests also raise questions about privacy.","23andMe says it won't share customer medical data with third parties unless given explicit consent. The company also says it uses two-factor authentication and encryption to protect genetic results, and has never been hacked.","But privacy expert Peter Swire says just one breach would be hard to fix. \"If you have your credit card stolen, you cancel it and get a new credit card in two days,\" he said. \"If your DNA gets revealed to the world or to the hacker, it's really hard to get new DNA. It just doesn't happen.\"","Dokoupil took a test himself, and braced for a surprise (\"I am an only child of unmarried parents who lived a wild and crazy hippie existence\") that never came. \"Twenty-six-point-six percent Italian, as expected with a first name like Tony,\" he said.","Canning, though, is still working through the meaning of her own results, knowing she is now Jamaican-American: \"That is the weird thing  am I allowed to say that? I don't know. Can a DNA test tell me what I am and what my identity is? I don't know.\"","Canning told us her biological dad died before she could meet him, but her mother did come clean about him in the end (explaining, \"It was the '80s\"). But she's sure of one thing: her father is her father.","\"He doesn't care what a DNA test says; I've been his since the moment I was born,\" she said. \"Family isn't just blood, but family is what you make it, and family is your heart, and my dad is my dad.

Its cohort is large and, it seems, endlessly growing: 12 years after the LG Prada arguably launched the smartphone as we know it, were drowning in rectangular, internet-connected screens with apps that let you do the same thing over and over. Even your fridge can have a big tablet grafted to the front, and yes, you can watch TV on it.","So, we certainly dont need a new iPod Touch. But Apple is rumored to be developing one anyway.","Lets ignore for a second the thing that most demands our attentiona literal heap of electronic-waste that grows with each new gadget shipmentand think about the situation in terms of pure utility. The iPod Touch exists more for the company than it does for you: As AppleInsider has pointed out, its a relatively inexpensive ($199) way to get an iOS device to customers and, therefore, a route to funnel money into services like Apple Music and iTunesservices that are increasingly valuable to Cupertino.","The device doesnt exist in a vacuum, of course. The iPod Touch launched in 2007, six years after the introduction of the first iPod and shortly after Steve Jobs stepped on stage with the iPhone. This changes everything, he said. And it did. As smartphones and wireless internet spread, it seemed that everything with a screen should in fact have a touchscreen and that the availability of apps should be taken as a given whenever possible. Today, the Nintendo Switch has Hulu despite its junky display, the Google Home Hub has Crackle and Deezer, and your Michael Kors smartwatch can run iHeartRadio while you text from it. Touchscreens, internet, and apps are the three ingredients in the techno-molasses that has trapped us all.","Because our telephones are now essentially appendages linking our fingers and minds to the ever-growing expanse of the World Wide Web, we expect some continuity of service when we move from device to device. If you start a movie on your iPhone, you should be able to finish it on your PlayStation, and you should be able to stream Fortnite to Twitch with your Xbox for someone to watch on their Kindle Fire. The seed of the modern internet now has roots shooting through uncountable nodes, and any new device should strive to maintain those connections. Or so weve been told.","The problem is that no one asked for this, exactly. Any app or service may be great on its own, but the connected universe of apps and services, with its constant din of notifications and distractions, has become overwhelming. Its no big surprise that a debate around screen addiction has flared up in recent years. Apple itself recently debuted a feature that helps control your screen use. The Time Well Spent movement is, well, an actual movement.","All of which is to say that the utility of any new smartphone-like device is now questionable at best. The technology is everywhere, and that everywhere-ness has become a burden to the modern internet user.","And so, back to the iPod Touch: What was once a simple if revolutionary music-listening device became, like everything else, an everything device. If you want, you can put Slack on your iPod. You can Skype with it. This might have been great a decade ago, when the novelty of these functions shielded us from their harms and there were far fewer of them to begin with, but in 2019, its a disaster. Though the burden may ultimately fall to an individual user to take responsibility for their own screen time, putting an App Store on a device is kind of like introducing Chekhovs gunexpect the thing to be used.","What may be more useful, now, at the turn of a new decade, is a renewed focus on individual devices that excel at individual purposes. The classic clickwheel iPod was, for a time, the best portable music player. It helped you live your life with a soundtrack; so does an iPhone, but it will shudder with notifications and tempt you with apps that ask to be their own lived experiences. You could pop an earbud out midsong to give someone directions, but you cant really hold a conversation with your mom while youre reading a notification from Twitter.","When the paradigm shifted in consumer technology toward online services and social networking, Apple phased out the clickwheel and kept the Touch, a device that found some kind of parity with the iPhone. It was a sensible move that helped bring iOS to people who didnt yet want to buy a smartphone. The entire market moved in this direction, and the differences between this thing and any other similar thing became boring and obvious. Different app ecosystems, perhaps. Different screen sizes. Same function.","Now, we have a parade of devices that are roughly the same amount of good at everything.The entire sales pitch of the iPad Pro is that it might also function as a laptop, and a new category of foldable screens has emerged in an effort to find the person who needs, at any given moment, both a 7.3-inch screen and a 4.6-inch one. The result is not to create new functionality; its to fit current functionality into whatever few open spots remain in our lives.","The invasion of the smart rectangles is, Id bet, what drives our exhaustion more than any given app. The status quo is to interact with these things whenever possible. Stitching Screen Time into iOS cant fix it.","But more purposeful devices could. An iPod thats just for musicupdated to work with the streaming Apple Music service, perhapsmight help us create space away from our phones, laptops, and tablets. In an era thats seen new minimalist phones and wild demand for totally offline classic consoles from Nintendo, a revival doesnt seem particularly unreasonable. Amazon still makes Kindle e-readers, after all: Theyre less functional than the Kindle Fire tablet, perhaps, but theres a reason many people prefer to read e-books on them.","So, bring back the clickwheel.","Weve been moving to the point of app saturation for 12 years. For a time, there was a reason to be enthralled by the glossy black touchscreen and its many apps. Now we can feel how theyre broken, and how theyve broken us. For a better tomorrow, we could do worse than to take inspiration from the past.","Damon Beres","Deputy Editor, OneZero, at Medium","OneZero","Mediums technology and science publication"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The trouble is that the files are too big. Say your photos total 50MB. Thats way too much for email.","The old solutions: Split the photos up and send smaller emails. Thats a real pain for you and for the recipient. What about Dropbox? Sure, but then you have to copy the files to Dropbox, and get a link. Do you even have the Dropbox app on your iPhone?","What about WeTransfer? Sure. Just try to enjoy waiting for the upload.","The fix: Mail Drop. Just compose your too-big email as usual, and let Mail Drop take care of it.","Whats Mail Drop?","Mail Drop is an Apple trick that uses iCloud as a holding space for large email attachments. When you send the mail, the Mail app uploads the images to iCloud, and includes a link in the email. In the case of photos, there will be thumbnail previews, too, so the recipient knows what theyre getting. Then, the recipient clicks or taps the links to download the originals.","How to use Mail Drop","This is the very best part: You dont really have to do anything to use Mail Drop. It goes like this:","If the Mail app thinks that your attachments are too big for email, it will suggest that you use Mail Drop. All you have to do is tap Use Mail Drop:","If youre using an email service that supports oversized attachments, like Gmail, then you can tap Try Sending Attachments to do just that. Be aware that the recipients email service may not accept them, though.","Bonus content","Mail Drop has other advantages, too. One is that the recipient can see and read the email without downloading all the attachments. Thats good if theyre on cellular data. They can see the mail, and grab the download later.","If you send photos, and the recipient is also using an Apple device, then theyll see a button to add those images directly to the Photos app.","Possible glitches","Mail Drop works great, but beware some possible hiccups. For instance, it may be that the recipients email service cannot handle even the thumbnails added to the email, and the whole thing will be rejected. In that case, youll have to resort to one of the other options, or just send smaller versions of the original images.","Thats a rare case, but one I have run into.

Independent brokers fear the move could spur a wider industry trend, as carriers look to cut distribution costs. The move will not affect the firms 1.2 million current policyholders.","Genworths decision is the latest blow to the deeply-troubled industry. Sales of traditional policies have declined by more than 90 percent over the past decade and fewer than a dozen carriers still are selling the product. Most are organized as mutual, policyholder-owned companies. While Genworth still is publicly-held, it agreed in 2016 to be acquired by China Oceanwide Holdings Group. However, the deal has yet to be completed.","Combo products","These days, consumers mostly are buying so-called combo or hybrid policies that link long-term care coverage with annuities or life insurance. According to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, about 350,000 policies were purchased last year, but fewer than 60,000 were traditional, stand-alone policies. Another analyst, LIMRA, estimated that consumers purchased about 260,000 combo policies and about 60,000 stand-alone products in 2017.","Combo products come in many varieties, usually as riders to annuities or to whole or universal life insurance. With life policies, for instance, you may use a portion of your death benefit to pay for long-term care needs. Anything left over would go to your beneficiary.","While these products may be attractive to wealthier consumers, they are complicated and may come with added fees. Middle-income households with limited assets may be able to afford only partial coverage for their long-term care needs. But consumers often are attracted to a feature not available with traditional long-term care insurance: You receive benefits even if you have no long-term care needs.","At least in theory, stand-alone policies still make sense for many middle-market buyers. But high premiums have driven most consumers out of that market, even as uncertain risk has chased away nearly all carriers.","Reserves and rate hikes","In February, Genworth took an additional $327 million fourth-quarter pre-tax charge to boost the reserves it will need to pay future LTC insurance claims. It was just the latest in billions of dollars in reserves it has added in recent years. At the same time, the carrier is continuing its efforts to convince state insurance regulators to allow it to impose annual, small premium increases on policyholders, much like health insurance, rather than less frequent but much bigger premium hikes that are the standard for long-term care policies.","Last month, GE, which still has about 274,000 legacy long-term care policies it sold before spinning off the Genworth unit in 2003, announced it would request $1.7 billion in premium increases through 2029.","Hallway chatter","Last week, I attended the industrys annual conference in Chicago. Many programs focused on finding better ways to measure risk and others were about dementiathe single biggest uncertainty for both carriers and consumers. Roughly half of all long-term care insurance claims come from policyholders with Alzheimers and other dementias.","Other sessions discussed public options for long-term care coverage, such as pending legislation in Washington State to create a social insurance benefit of $36,500. Many insurance executives who had long criticized public programs such as Washingtons, now see it as an opportunity to rethink private insurance.","Company execs also were interested in the new Medicare Advantage benefits for supports and services. Last year, for the first time, Congress and the Trump Administration allowed plans to offer non-medical supplemental benefits such as personal care aides or home modifications.","While these benefits are modest and plan participation is low, this initiative could break down the long-standing barriers between medical care and social supports.

Heres why that drives us crazy.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["There are many fascinating, upsetting details in the story of Elizabeth Holmes, but my favorite is her voice. Holmes, the ousted Theranos founder who was indicted last year on federal fraud charges for hawking an essentially imaginary product to multi-millionaire investors, pharmacies, and hospitals, speaks in a deep baritone that, as it turns out, is allegedly fake. Former co-workers of Holmes told The Dropout, a new podcast about Theranoss downfall, that Holmes occasionally fell out of character and exposed her real, higher voice  particularly after drinking. (Holmess family recently denied these claims to TMZ, insisting her voice is naturally low, just like her grandmothers.)","In the new Theranos HBO documentary, The Inventor, Holmes baritone is on full, strange display. There is a moment in which the camera person filming Holmes for an earlier interview segment asks her what her favorite Star Wars sound is (?), and she says Yoda. The cameraman then asks her to do Yodas voice, and for a moment, I held my breath. She pauses, and then, in the same deep mumble, recites: Do or do not, there is no try.","If you hunt around online, you can sometimes find YouTube videos in which Holmes can be heard using that real voice before catching herself and deepening it, but these videos have a tendency to be taken down after a day or two. This, of course, only makes me more interested. Holmes is obviously guilty of many more serious crimes, but faking ones voice is just weird, and embarrassing, in much the same way that bad toupees are: they place ones bodily insecurities center stage. Plus, now shell have to do this voice for the rest of her life (?), and its all I can think about.The internets reaction to the podcast, and to Bad Blood, John Carreyrous book about Theranos, suggests Im not alone.","Personally, the episode has brought me back to an equally thrilling (if smaller) faked-voice scandal, in which a former co-worker of mine, after speaking in a straightforward East Coast accent for more than a year, suddenly developed an accent she labeled British, but which sounded more Australian. Nobody knew what to do, except gossip profusely. I still wonder about that co-worker, and I expect I will for the rest of my life. Ditto Elizabeth. So in order to better understand people like them (voice-fakers), I talked to Jillian OConnor, an assistant professor of psychology at Concordia University who studies voices influence on others perceptions.","Perhaps the most important thing to remember, OConnor tells me, is that people generally do the things they do because they believe the benefits greatly outweigh the costs. In other words: Holmes (and my co-worker, supposedly) had her reasons, even if they dont make sense to the rest of us. Namely: she thought it would achieve the desired effect of making her seem like a Silicon Valley visionary, says OConnor. This whole [Holmes] situation, the image manipulation, dressing like Steve Jobs, trying to sound a particular way it sounds like an awful lot went into facade, she says. Given the many millions of dollars invested in Holmes non-functioning blood box, her effort was  worth it, at least for a time. OConnor says the research backs the effort behind Holmess baritone, too: Some of the research weve worked on shows that when men and women deliberately lower their voices, its actually successful, she says. They do sound more dominant. They do sound more likely to be someone whos in a position of power. This belief, of course, is rooted in sexism, and the idea that men (and especially hyper-masculine men) are more fit to lead than women, and certainly not feminine ones. There are seemingly fewer scenarios in which a higher voice is beneficial, though women with higher voices are perceived as more fertile, feminine, and diminutive than their lower-voiced peers, which may partly explain the babygirl whisper Paris Hilton perfected on The Simple Life.","As for the accent fakers, research also confirms that Americans, at least, perceive people speaking with a British accent as smarter and higher in social status, says OConnor. (The research on British-Australian accents developed suddenly isnt there yet, sadly.) In both cases, the faked voice exploits very real cultural biases, working to enhance our impressions of their speakers. It might be a particularly weird technique, but the need being expressed here is very basically human, says OConnor. People generally like to be liked, and [things like voice] are salient differences that stick out, and have positive associations, she says. Were more likely to try and highlight those aspects, and apparently, in some cases, maybe even create them. What were not so fond of, however, is witnessing the change take place, as in the case of Meghan Markle. I think this goes back to my toupee analogy: the facade is one thing, but to be caught in the act of creating it renders it inauthentic, and if theres one thing we cant stand, its perceived inauthenticity. To those of us who knew the Holmeses and Markles of the world before their new voices, they likely seem nuts, but consider all the people they met after: might they not take that voice at face-value, appreciating it for its pitch or particular accent?","While its tempting to think were all excellent at separating a faked voice from a real one, OConnor says thats only half true. We might be really good at picking up on the people who are bad at faking their voice, she says, but not at the ones that seem to be more expert. For instance: compare Rene Zellweger, God bless her, in Bridget Joness Diary to Christian Bale in, I dont know, anything. (Hes Welsh! You forgot again, didnt you.) Id like to think Id have suspected Elizabeth Holmes right away, but Ive only become aware of her voice after learning it was faked, so Ill never know for sure. And I can say from experience that knowing a voice is fake doesnt make it any less mystifying.","Perhaps what most perplexes us about the faked voice, then, is the effort relative to the effect. Imagine the effort, the training, the strain and the concentration that would take, day in and day out, just to control your voice while going about your everyday life, says OConnor. Imagine fearing that youd slip into your real voice after two and half wines, or in your sleep. Does Elizabeth Holmes use her baritone when she speaks to her boyfriend, or does he get the real deal? I simply cannot relax until I find out.","Stay in touch.","Tags:","Most Viewed Stories","Best of The Cut","Promoted links by Taboola","The Latest"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Now there's a vacant seat and many names are swirling, including Hammer's. TMZ caught up with the actor and asked him point-blank about possibly getting the role, and Hammer said no in just about every possible way imaginable.","First, he was asked \"Are you the new Batman Armie?\" to which he said \"No.\" When asked if he could confirm it, Hammer said, \"I can't\". He was then asked if he's denying it for real, and he said \"Yes!\" After that, the TMZ cameraman asked, \"how about if I see you with a cape,\" to which Hammer responded, \"then you'll know I'm lying.\"","We're playing some BAT-MIND games with Armie Hammer ? pic.twitter.com/Cr4P59fsEm","So, it would appear as if Hammer is, at least as of now, not connected to the role at all.

It's more Batman in his detective mode than we've seen in the films. The comics have a history of that. He's supposed to be the world's greatest detective, and that's not necessarily been a part of what the movies have been. I'd love this to be one where when we go on that journey of tracking down the criminals and trying to solve a crime, it's going to allow his character to have an arc so that he can go through a transformation.\"","Do you think Hammer is telling the truth?

Marijuana-infused foods and candies, called edibles, also led to trouble. Patients came to the ER with symptoms such as repeated vomiting, racing hearts and psychotic episodes.","The study, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, stemmed from tales of tourists needing emergency care after gobbling too many marijuana gummies.","\"It was hard to know if these were just anecdotes or if there was a true phenomenon,\" said lead author Dr. Andrew Monte of UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital.","Three deaths in Colorado tied to edible products also prompted the study.","Emergency room records from Monte's hospital show a three-fold increase in marijuana cases since the state became the first to allow sales of recreational marijuana in January 2014. Nearly a third of patients were admitted to the hospital, evidence of severe symptoms, Monte said.","In 2012, the ER saw an average of one patient every other day with a marijuana-caused problem. By 2016, the count was two to three per day.","That's not enough to swamp the emergency department, Monte said, but it stresses an already burdened system.","Most people can use marijuana safely, Monte said, but with its increased availability and higher THC concentrations, \"we may be seeing more adverse drug reactions,\" he said.","THC is the part of marijuana that gets people high.","A growing cannabis industry promotes the drug as a cure-all while downplaying dangers, said Dr. Erik Messamore, a psychiatrist at Northeast Ohio Medical University who wasn't involved in the research. More than 30 states now allow marijuana for at least medical use. New Jersey is debating becoming the 11th state to approve recreational pot. The U.S. government considers marijuana illegal.","\"You can't trust the people who sell the drugs to be upfront with the risk,\" Messamore said, calling for warning labels similar to those on tobacco products.","The analysis confirmed edibles are trouble. Statewide, they made up less than 1 percent of total cannabis sales, measured by THC content. Yet 11 percent of ER visits were triggered by edibles.","Monte said edibles are too dangerous to be part of the recreational marketplace. Slow to kick in, their effects last too long for a good party drug, he said. They work better for those who want to use them as medicine.","Yet information on safe dosing is lacking, as Denver resident Arlene Galchinsky learned. She took a marijuana gummy for pain on top of a prescription narcotic, becoming so disoriented her husband called paramedics. Galchinsky, 79, didn't go to the ER, but the experience shook her up.","\"It was extremely scary,\" she said of the feeling. \"When was this going to go away? It was so frightening.\"","In the state-funded study , there were 2,567 emergency visits at the Denver hospital caused by marijuana from 2012-2016. It's not just tourists; 9 out of 10 cases were Colorado residents.","Seventeen percent of the visits were for uncontrolled bouts of vomiting. It was most often from inhaled marijuana, not edibles.","Twelve percent of the cases were for acute psychosis, where people without a history of mental disorders lose touch with reality. That was more frequently seen with edibles.","Intoxication and heart problems were other common complaints.","In an editorial, Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, called for more research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. She and co-author Ruben Baler wrote there is an \"urgent need\" for greater oversight of manufacturing and labeling as marijuana use increases with state legalization.","Monte, an ER doctor who specializes in toxicology, doesn't use marijuana. \"I'm too busy,\" he said. \"I can't spend time being high.\"","Trump struggles with a growing problem on the border","Jury rejects Harry Reid lawsuit against fitness band maker","Minnesota student group seeks to expand makerspace access","Wisconsin family fosters dog from Qatar","Wisconsin man pushes for labor reform 20 years after crash","StarTribune","Company","Advertise with us","Buy","Customer support","Website"," 2019 StarTribune.

After all, if Shuri hadnt been dusted, you think she wouldve made her presence known pretty sharpish. That she hasnt makes it clear that she was another of Thanos billions of casualties.

Wednesday it was revealed that Angelina Jolie is in talks to join Chloe Zhao's The Eternals.\n\nWhile details on the film have been locked up tighter than Odin's vault, The Eternals, based on the epic saga by comic book legend Jack Kirby, focuses on immortal superpowered beings created by the Celestials, the cosmic giants seen in the Infinity Stones sequence in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Zhao's film is said to be led by Sersi and Ikaris, two Eternals whose love story rests at the center of an eons-spanning conflict.\n\nMarvel had no comment on who Jolie might play, but given that she's the first actor to be cast, it seems likely that she's up for the transmutation-powered Sersi. Jolie also looks a great deal like many artists' depiction of the character. But who is Sersi? And what does Jolie's casting tell us about the film?","Unlike the previous films that have made up the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Eternals is based around largely unknown entities, even for most comic book readers. This unknown quality plus the fact that Marvel Comics hasn't made much effort in reprinting Kirby's series or key appearances of the characters (yet), adds a level of excitement and novelty to Zhao's feature. As a property that's more situated in the realm of sci-fi and fantasy than superhero yarns, learning about the Eternals is akin to taking a deep-dive into J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth history or George R.R. Martin's Westeros and Essos. While the Guardians of the Galaxy were mostly unknown to most audiences before 2014, the Eternals are even more of a deep-dive into the Marvel Universe. When it comes to the Celestials, the Eternals and their evil counterparts the Deviants (Thanos' race), this is heavy Marvel mythology, the building blocks of the universe, and far more complex than anything we've seen Marvel Studios adapt thus far.","Casting Jolie in a film such as this is a way for Marvel to ground the audience in a complicated mythology with a familiar face. But it's also a signal that if an actress on this level of influence, one who has largely focused on directing and producing of late, is interested, then it must be something special.\n\nMarvel Studios, with a few exceptions, has long played the game of star-making when it comes to leading roles, taking talented actors and actresses known from television and award-season breakouts and making them household names or reviving the public's perception of them. There's been a certain tier of actors who first broke box office records and sold magazine covers in the '90s  Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Jolie  who have somehow managed to avoid being in a superhero film. But it now seems as though everyone must do at least one. Despite being a favorite for numerous superhero roles since the '90s and being an early rumored choice to direct Captain Marvel, Jolie has stayed away from superhero movies. Sure, she played Lara Croft twice and starred in the comic adaptation of Wanted (2008), which stripped away the superhero element of Mark Millar's comic, and she went all-in on the costumed villainess in Maleficent (2014) and its upcoming sequel. But she's never played a true superhero before.","Yet Sersi, if speculation is indeed correct, seems like a fitting choice for Jolie. Not only does the role provide her with the opportunity to work with Zhao, whose film The Rider (2017) makes the filmmakers seem like kindred spirits, but Sersi reflects many of Jolie's own acting choices and interests.\n\nCreated by Jack Kirby, Sersi first appeared in Strange Tales No. 109 (1963), with the name spelled \"Circe,\" then later as Sersi in The Eternals No. 3 (1976). The distinction in spelling highlights a very important aspect of The Eternals' comic book history. While Greek gods and goddesses exist in the Marvel Universe, they would often let the Olympia-based Eternals represent their physical forms for the humans on Earth, hence many of the Eternals sharing names similar to their Greek counterparts. This distinction sounds like something the MCU will merge and just make the Eternals the inspiration for the Greek Pantheon, like the Asgardians were the basis for the Norse Gods. The comics have already done some of this synthesizing. Sersi inspired the poet Homer, who included her under the name Circe in The Odysseyin which she turned men into swine. Because of her powers to manipulate matter and rearrange molecular structures, she was often seen as a witch rather than a result of alien experimentation, allowing her to move across comic book genres.","While most of the Eternals eventually returned to the cosmos in search of their larger destiny, Sersi remained on Earth, fascinated with its people and customs. She involved herself in key moments in history, lived in ancient Rome and Camelot, fought alongside Thor and the Vikings in the god's youth and later joined the Avengers.\n\nHaving lived for millennia, Sersi has taken on many roles on Earth and has changed her personality as she's seen fit, taking the most out of her immortal existence. This worldliness and interest in alleviating human conflict and suffering falls in line with Jolie's own humanitarian and conservation efforts. As the line between actors and the superheroes they play grows increasingly thin (see Chris Evans' political interests, and Gal Gadot and Brie Larson's movement for women in film), Sersi may be a way for Jolie to get her message out to a wider audience, and exhibit godlike powers while doing it.","It's impossible to capture the massive potential and mythology of The Eternals through one character and casting choice. But Jolie's involvement at least gives us a better idea of what's coming down the road post-Avengers: Endgame. Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige has promised a very different MCU after April 26, and if Jolie's casting and Sersi's eons-spanning history and mythology is any indication, Marvel's storytelling and casting is only growing in ambition.","Richard Newby","Heat Vision","The Comic Horror Behind the 'Joker' Trailer","The Emotional Arc at the Heart of the 'Avengers: Endgame' Trailers","Do 'Avengers: Endgame' Flashbacks Reveal How It All Ends?"," 2019 The Hollywood Reporter\n\nAll rights reserved.","The Hollywood Reporter, LLC is a subsidiary of Prometheus Global Media, LLC.","Terms of Use |\nPrivacy |\nSitemap |\nAbout Our Ads","Our affiliate publications"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Hawaii's long-standing cattle trade is hampered by the Jones Act. For nearly 100 years the Jones Act has restricted the transportation of cargo between two points in the United States to ships that are U.S.-built, crewed, owned, and flagged. Meant to bolster the U.S. maritime industry and provide a ready supply of ships and mariners in times of conflict, the act has instead presided over a steady deterioration in the number of ships, sailors to crew them, and shipyards to build them. While failing to provide its promised benefits, the law has imposed a huge economic burden that manifests itself in various ways, ranging from higher transportation costs to increased traffic and pollution.Learn more at https://www.cato.org/jonesact#EndTheJonesAct","Category","Loading...","Up next","Loading...","Loading...","Loading...","Loading...","Working...","Add to","Loading playlists..."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Sitting across from him at a sleek wood table is Jewel Burks Solomon who, after selling her startup to Amazon, invests time and money in helping other entrepreneurs make their mark in the tech industry.","As Blackwell shows off how algebra formulas in Make Music Count play melodies and chords from popular hip-hop and pop songs, Solomon counsels him on everything from how to get exposure to how to land funding for his app.","This kind of informal coaching session happens hourly in cafes all over San Francisco and Palo Alto, California. The difference here: Nearly everyone in this room is black.","Welcome to the city that's emerging as the nation's black tech capital. For a growing number of African-Americans in the tech world, Atlanta is beckoning. Weary of coastal hubs that don't reflect America'sgrowing diversity, they are packing up their lives and careers for acity with a rich history of entrepreneurship, a booming black middle class, affordable quality of lifeand a small but growing tech scene.","Nowhere is Atlanta's cresting wave of black innovation more evident than here at The Gathering Spot, a members-only, co-working and business networking hub on the site of a turn-of-the-century railway yard west of downtown Atlanta. You never know who you might run into:Voting rights activistStacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 race for governor of Georgia, rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, the cast of \"Greenleaf\" from the Oprah Winfrey Network, and a who's who of the local digerati, like Solomon.","\"I don't think there is a better place in the country if you're a black entrepreneur to be,\" Ryan Wilson, co-founder of The Gathering Spot, says of Atlanta. \"I definitely stand as an example of what's possible in this city if you really stay rooted here.\"","Even as tech companies pour money into increasingthe diversity of their work forces, African-Americans remain sharply underrepresented in tech jobs nationwide. But not in the city that's been dubbedSilicon Valley of the South.","One in four tech workersin the Atlanta metropolitan area are African-American, significantly more than San Jose, California, where 2.5 percent of the tech workforce is black, and San Francisco, where 6.4 percent of the tech workforce is black, according to a Brookings Institution study on black and Hispanic under-representation in the industry.","Opportunity isn't distributed equally at all levels, however, even here. Though Atlanta's black workforce in tech is much larger, so isthe equity gap. Black workers' representation in technical positions in the region is 8 percentage points below their presence in the workforce, the Brookings Institution found.","Like in Silicon Valley, white men dominate the leadership of tech companies in Atlanta. Blacks make up 5 percent of executives and 11 percent of managers at area tech companies, according to regional data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And venture capital dollars aren't much easier to come by in Atlanta than in Silicon Valley for black entrepreneurs.","For years, investors mostly flew through not into the city. Winds have begun to shift southward, sending a sprinkling of venture capital Atlanta's way. More than $1 billion was raised in 2017 and nearly $1 billion in 2018, four times the amount tech financiers invested in the area a decade ago, according to data from theanalytics firm PitchBook.","Still, the volume in Atlanta barely registers on the scale of the massive wealth-generating machine of Silicon Valley, and little of that money isreaching black entrepreneurs.","\"There isnt a lot of early-stage investment flowing into African-American startups,\" says Kathryn Finney who runs an organization, Digitalundivided, which prepares black and Latina tech foundersfor pitch meetings with venture capitalists. \"So Digitalundivided teaches Atlanta-based founders to focus on building a solid business and then seek funding for growth.\"","Atlanta draws Silicon Valley transplants","None of these downsides have undercutthe enthusiasm of recent transplants. In December, whenone of the nation's most prominent black entrepreneurs,Tristan Walker, sold his startupto consumer giant Procter & Gamble, he sent tremors through Silicon Valleywith the announcement thathe was also relocatingWalker & Company Brandsto Atlanta.","His modern personal care line for people of color, from shaving products to shampoo, has raised millions from venture capitalists and the likes of rapper Nas and singer-songwriterJohn Legend, targeting a market worth billions but woefully underserved. Walker, who runs a majority-minority company, says he wantedto bringhis businesscloser to hiscustomers and to the pulse of black culture.","\"It's such a thrilling time for the celebration of blackness and the hope of what that can mean for this country,\" he says.","The cross-country move comessix years after Walkerco-foundedCode2040, anonprofit that funnels African-American and Hispanic engineers into tech companies.","\"I can't count how many articles have been written on the dearth of diversity in Silicon Valley, yet theproblem's not getting better. And why?\" Helets the question hang in the air. \"There's no reason why it shouldn't or wouldn't.\"","Silicon Valley may have the nation's greatest density of genius per square mile, he says, but Atlanta lays claim to the greatest density of black genius. \"The feeling I get when I go to Atlantanow,\" he says, \"is the same feeling I got in 2008 when I moved to Silicon Valley.\"","Late last year, Jareau Wad, vice president of growth at a financial tech company, Finix Payments, tradeda $3,800-a-month townhouse that he rented but could not afford to buy in the Bay Areafor a mortgage on a four-bedroom home in Atlanta that's less than half that.","It wasn't just the quality of life andcost of living differences. Wad says he and his wife longed to raise their 6-month-old daughter closer to family and to the black community.","\"Black people can't just move anywhere in the U.S. and expect to live near other black people,\" he says. \"So when black families move to the Bay Area the absence of black people is conspicuous.\"","That feeling of isolation extended to work. Wad recalls spotting someone he knew one day in his startup CEO's office and poking his head in to say hello. \"How do you two know each other?\" the CEO asked. \"We are both black in tech,\" Wad replied.","Silicon Valley wasn't the right fit for Sheena Allen, either. Allen, who grew up in rural Mississippi and whose startup, CapWay, is a digital alternative to traditional banking, decamped to Atlantain Januaryto be in the southerncapital of financial tech.She first landed in Silicon Valley in 2012 andreturned in 2018, only to discover that, despite all the industry talk about becoming more inclusive, she was still the only black person in the room.","\"They call Atlanta the capital of black excellence, and I do see a lot of people of color here. It's also a melting pot of fashion, athletics, entertainment, music, reality TV,\" she says. \"For me, that makes a huge difference.\"","'We are just warming up'","Paul Judge, a veteran of successful tech companies and widely considered the godfather of the Atlanta tech scene, has been spreadingthewordfor the past two decades.","In 2014, Judge published a guide to Atlanta's startup scene on the tech news site Pando titled,\"Hip-hop, housewives and hot startups.\" \"Many people outside of Atlanta are more familiar with the former: hip-hop and 'real' housewives,\" he wrote at the time. \"Of those two things, one makes us proud and one makes us, lets just say, not so proud. Hot startups though weve been busy on that front.\"","Today, the latest security firm he co-founded, Pindrop, which raised another $90 million in December, is spread out over three floors of the historic Biltmore Hotel, just a quick jog from TechSquare Labs, where Judge helps the ideas of fellow entrepreneurs take flight. His fiance, Tanya Sam, is director of partnerships at TechSquare Labs and ironically recently joined the \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" cast.","\"It has become very clear that what is occurring in Atlanta is unique,\" Judge says. \"We have to keep nurturing it and get better telling the world about it.\"","That philosophy is behind his recent investment in Atlanta's A3C Festival and Conference. He's working to bring big Silicon Valley names to the annual shindig that serves up music, hip hop, culture and tech each October. His vision: an event that rivals Austin's South by Southwest or the Aspen Ideas Festival.","\"This next chapter in Atlanta is going to be exciting,\" Judge says. \"We are just warming up.\"","Melting pot of colleges, corporations and culture","Regions around the country New York, Bostons Route 128 and Austin, Texas  have attempted to replicate the alchemy of the Bay Area, with its deep-pocketed investors, risk-taking culture, world-class universities, crush of technical talent and track record of turning startup dreams into breakout successes.","Atlanta has its own competitive edge witha melting pot of colleges (Georgia Tech and historicallyblack collegessuch as Morehouse and Spelman, which are producing more black engineers than anywhere in the country), major corporations (Atlanta is home to one of the largest concentrations of Fortune 500 companies, including Coca-Cola and Home Depot) and chart-topping culture in film, television and music (filmmaker Tyler Perry, musician and actor Donald Glover and rap duo Outkast, not to mention \"Black Panther,\" which was filmed in and around Atlanta).","Tech is already a significant player here, accounting for 12.5 percent, or $42 billion, of the city's economy. And its national profile is rising. Atlanta ranks in the top 10 \"tech towns\"in the nation, outpacing traditional strongholds such as Boston and Washington, D.C., according to CompTIA, a tech industry trade group.","Job postings run into the tens of thousands. The tech labor pool has increased nearly 35 percent over the past five years, the third fastest pace in the nation, and faster than the Bay Area, real estate firm CBRE says.","\"The tech industry is just growing rapidly in terms of the entrepreneurship and the startup space,\" says Marcellus Haynes, founder of Atlanta's Technologists of Color Meet-up, which has an email list of 2,600. \"We are creating a fertile environment that a lot of companies want to take advantage of.\"","What might put Atlanta over the top is the racial diversity of its tech industry and a groundswell of activity to boost opportunities for blacks and other entrepreneurs of color.

The city transformed into a black mecca in the 1970s under the stewardship of Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor and great-grandson of slaves who won the first of three terms in 1973 and oversaw the construction of what would become the nation's busiest airport.","Today, African-Americans are reversing the great migration, abandoning the Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Detroit to reclaim cities in the South.","Brookings Institution demographer William Frey, author of \"Diversity Explosion: How New Racial Demographics are Remaking America,\" says Atlanta leads all other metropolitan areas in black migration, increasing more than five-fold from 1970 to 2017.","Leading that migration are younger, highly educated blacks who want quality of life without the avocado toast price tag.Over 99 percent of Atlanta zip codes 210 out of 212 are less expensivethan the cheapest zip code in the San Jose metro area, according to Bert Sperling, founder of Best Places, a websitethat ranks locationsacross the United States. Thatmeansyou can trade a $200,000 salary in San Francisco for a $75,747 salary in Atlanta and not sacrifice a thing.","Another big draw for African-Americans is the largenumber of entrepreneurs. Some 20 percent of the black working population in Atlanta is self-employed, the highest proportion in the nation, according to a study from demographer Joel Kotkin, a presidential fellow in urban futures at Chapman University in Orange, California, and executive director of the Center for Opportunity Urbanism.","In a majority-black city where22.4 percent ofresidents livebelow thepoverty level, black tech entrepreneurs are jumping at the chance to work in a place supportive of tackling issues affecting black people and marginalized communities.","Horace Williams launched Empowrd, an app that provides information on elected officials and connects people with advocacy groups, in 2015 after George Zimmerman was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin in Florida in hopes of getting more black people to take part in the democratic process.","In 2017, Jasmine Crowe founded Goodr, a mobile app that fights hunger and food waste by getting restaurants and companies to donate surplus food to homeless shelters, affordable housing communities and other agencies.","Blackwell says his app, which is being tested in Atlanta Public Schools, was inspired by his desire to see black children excel in math.\"I think what's missing with education is meeting students where they are and the communities they come from,\"Blackwellsays. \"It's important for me to help close this achievement gap.\"","Morgan DeBaun, chief executive of Blavity, a popular digital media hub for black millennials, says she decided to open a tech office in Atlanta last year to take advantage of all thislocal black engineering talent.","DeBaun spends a week in Atlanta each month.

Now 46, he still skateboards.","* The charismatic politician with the Kennedy smile is liberal on some issues and libertarian on others, which could allow him to cross the countrys political divide.","One thing you didnt know: While a teenager, ORourke acknowledged in an exclusive interview, he belonged to the oldest group of computer hackers in U.S. history.","Members of the hugely influential Cult of the Dead Cow, jokingly named after an abandoned Texas slaughterhouse, have protected his secret for decades, reluctant to compromise his political viability.","Now, in a series of interviews, CDC members have acknowledged ORourke as one of their own. In all, more than a dozen members of the group agreed to be named for the first time in a book about the hacking group by this reporter that is scheduled to be published in June by Public Affairs. ORourke was interviewed early in his run for the Senate.","ORourkes membership in the group  notorious for releasing tools that allowed ordinary people to hack computers running Microsofts Windows, and also known for inventing the word hacktivism to describe human-rights-driven security work  could explain his approach to politics better than anything on his resume. His background in hacking circles has repeatedly informed his strategy as he explored and subverted established procedures in technology, the media and government.","Theres just this profound value in being able to be apart from the system and look at it critically and have fun while youre doing it, ORourke said. I think of the Cult of the Dead Cow as a great example of that.","An ex-hacker running for national office would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. But that was before two national elections sent people from other nontraditional backgrounds to the White House and Congress, many of them vowing to blow up the status quo.","Arguably, there has been no better time to be an American politician rebelling against business as usual. There is no indication that ORourke himself ever engaged in the edgiest sorts of hacking activity - breaking into computers or writing code that enabled others to do so. Still, its unclear whether the United States is ready for a presidential contender who, as a teenager, stole long-distance phone service for his dial-up modem, wrote a murder fantasy in which the narrator drives over children on the street, and mused about a society without money.","THE ERA OF MODEMS AND BULLETIN BOARDS","ORourke was a misfit teen in El Paso, Texas, in the 1980s when he decided to seek out bulletin board systems  the online discussion forums that at the time were the best electronic means for connecting people outside the local school, church and neighborhood.","When Dad bought an Apple IIe and a 300-baud modem and I started to get on boards, it was the Facebook of its day, he said. You just wanted to be part of a community.","ORourke soon started his own board, TacoLand, which was freewheeling and largely about punk music. This was the counterculture: Maximum Rock & Roll [magazine], buying records by catalog you couldnt find at record stores, he said.","He then connected with another young hacker in the more conservative Texas city of Lubbock who ran a bulletin board called Demon Roach Underground. Known online as Swamp Rat, Kevin Wheeler had recently moved from a university town in Ohio and was having problems adjusting to life in Texas.","Like ORourke, Wheeler said, he was hunting for video games that had been cracked, or stripped from digital rights protections, so that he could play them for free on his Apple. Also like ORourke, Wheeler wanted to find other teens who enjoyed the same things, and to write and share funny and profane stories that their parents and conservative neighbors wouldnt appreciate. It was good-natured resistance to the repressive humdrum around them, a sort of Footloose for those just discovering the new world of computers.","Wheeler and a friend named the Cult of the Dead Cow after an eerie hangout, a shut-down Lubbock slaughterhouse  the unappealing hind part of Texas iconic cattle industry. Most CDC members kept control of their own bulletin boards while referring visitors to one anothers and distributing the CDCs own branded essays, called text files or t-files.","At the time, people connected to bulletin boards by dialing in to the phone lines through a modem. Heavy use of long-distance modem calls could add up to hundreds of dollars a month. Savvy teens learned techniques for getting around the charges, such as using other peoples phone-company credit card numbers and five-digit calling codes to place free calls.","ORourke didnt say what techniques he used. Like thousands of others, though, he said he pilfered long-distance service so I wouldnt run up the phone bill.","Under Texas law, stealing long-distance service worth less than $1,500 is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine. More than that is a felony, and could result in jail time. It is unclear whether ORourke topped that threshold. In any event, the state bars prosecution of the offense for those under 17, as ORourke was for most of his active time in the group, and the statute of limitations is five years. Two Cult of the Dead Cow contemporaries in Texas who were caught misusing calling cards as minors got off with warnings.","ORourke handed off control of his own board when he moved east for boarding school, and he said he stopped participating on the hidden CDC board after he enrolled at Columbia University at age 18.","Hana Callaghan, a government specialist at Santa Clara Universitys Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, said that voters might want to consider both the gravity of any candidates offenses and the persons age at the time.","Among the questions voters should ask, she said: What was the violation? Was it egregious? What does it say about their character  do they believe the rules dont apply to them? If substantial time has passed, she added, voters should decide whether the person learned the error of their ways and no longer engages in those kind of behavior.","When he was a teen, ORourke also frequented sites that offered cracked software. The bulletin boards were a great way to get cracked games, ORourke said, adding that he later realized his habit wasnt morally defensible and stopped.","Using pirated software violates copyright laws, attorneys say, but in practice, software companies have rarely sued young people over it. When they do go after someone, it is typically an employer with workers using multiple unlicensed copies. Software providers are more interested in those who break the protections and spread their wares.","CDC wasnt of that ilk. Although some CDC essays gave programming and hacking instructions, in the late 1980s, the group was more about writing than it was about breaking into computer systems.","But its focus on creative expression didnt mean there were no grounds for controversy. Like many an underground newspaper, the Cult of the Dead Cow avidly pursued it.","A CDC member who joined in the early 1990s had previously used real instructions for making a pipe bomb to joke about shedding pounds by losing limbs. Three teenagers in Montreal found the file, and one lost two fingers after he tried to follow the formula, prompting outrage.","Rather than remove similar posts and hide the groups history, the CDC warned readers not to take the files literally and added a disclaimer that survives on its current web page: Warning: This site may contain explicit descriptions of or advocate one or more of the following: adultery, murder, morbid violence, bad grammar, deviant sexual conduct in violent contexts, or the consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs.","GRABBING MEDIA ATTENTION","ORourke and his old friends say his stint as a fledgling hacker fed into his subsequent work in El Paso as a software entrepreneur and alternative press publisher, which led in turn to successful long-shot runs at the city council and then Congress, where he unseated an incumbent Democrat.","Politically, ORourke has taken some conventional liberal positions, supporting abortion rights and opposing a wall on the Mexican border. But he takes a libertarian view on other issues, faulting excessive regulation and siding with businesses in congressional votes on financial industry oversight and taxes.","His more conservative positions have drawn fire from Democrats who see him as too friendly with Republicans and corporations. His more progressive votes and punk-rock past helped his recent opponent, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, portray ORourke as too radical for socially conservative Texas.","But the political balance allows him to appeal to both main strands of political thought in Silicon Valley  a key source of campaign money and cultural influence.","ORourke credits the Cult of the Dead Cow with developing his thinking in a number of ways. Not least, he fought to restore net neutrality, the principle which prevented internet providers from favoring some content over others.","Enthusiastically supported by large tech companies and consumer groups, net neutrality was formally adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015. The major telecommunications companies argued that it limited their ability to offer new services to content providers, and under the Trump Administration, the FCC overturned the policy in 2017. An attempt to legislate its reinstatement failed last year, although tech trade groups are still trying in court.","Hackers generally support net neutrality as part of a broader worldview that the free flow of information is necessary and good.","I understand the democratizing power of the internet, and how transformative it was for me personally, and how it leveraged the extraordinary intelligence of these people all over the country who were sharing ideas and techniques, ORourke said.","When you compromise the ability to treat all that equally, it runs counter to the ethics of the groups we were part of. And factually, you can just see that it will harm small-business development and growth. It hampers the ability to share what you are creating, whether it is an essay, a song, a piece of art.","ORourkes generation of hackers, and the Cult of the Dead Cow in particular, also thought deeply about how to grab media and public attention for a cause or a laugh. Group members, for instance, tossed raw meat from a Las Vegas stage, distributed an essay called Sex with Satan and falsely claimed the ability to hack satellites.","That media sense echoes in ORourkes political life.","As a congressman in 2016, while he and others were holding a sit-in at the House of Representatives to force a floor debate on gun control, the Republican Speaker, Paul Ryan, called a recess. That invoked the congressional rule that C-SPAN cant broadcast from its House cameras when the chamber isnt in session.","So ORourke began broadcasting the protest from his phone over Facebook, and the network aired that instead. The stunt drew attention to the majority partys refusal to deliberate on the issue, and it showed ORourkes willingness to upend convention.","During last years Senate campaign, ORourkes staff took videos of him interacting with voters all over the state, editing several that went viral on social media. That helped ORourke raise more money than any Senate candidate in history despite refusing donations from political action committees. While losing his race by less than three percentage points, he drew in new voters and helped flip House seats and other races down the ticket.","While considering a presidential run, ORourke has gone on a multistate road trip and posted videos of everyday activities, even including a dental visit.","Part of my success was being exposed to people who thought differently and explored how things work, ORourke said in the interview. There are alternate paths to service and success, and its important to be mindful of that.","THE WRITINGS OF PSYCHEDELIC WARLORD","ORourke, too, thought differently. His CDC writing from nearly three decades ago, under the handle Psychedelic Warlord, remains online.","One article he wrote as a teen mused how the world would work without money. After changing the system, including the government, ORourke foresaw the end of starvation and class distinctions.","To achieve a money-less society (or have a society where money is heavily de-emphasized) a lot of things would have to change, including government as we know it. This is where the anti-money group and the disciples of Anarchy meet, ORourke wrote under his pseudonym. I fear we will always have a system of government, one way or another, so we would have to use other means other than totally toppling the government (I dont think the masses would support such a radical move at this time).","Another t-file from ORourke, written when he was 15, is a short and disturbing piece of fiction. One day, as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street. They were happy, happy to be free from their troubles. This happiness was mine by right. I had earned it in my dreams.","As I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood, and then the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. I was so fascinated for a moment, that when after I had stopped my vehicle, I just sat in a daze, sweet visions filling my head.","In another piece, he took on a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi who maintained that Hitler was misunderstood and didnt personally want Jews killed. ORourke and a Jewish friend questioned the man about his theories and let him ramble about Jews and African Americans, an attempt to let him hang himself with his own words.","We were trying to see what made him think the horrible things that he did, he wrote in the file.","ORourke added that if readers wanted to learn more about the subjects Aryan church, they could write to the mans post office box in El Paso.","Surely, ORourke wrote, theyd appreciate some fan mail.","A RARE WOMAN IN THE HACKER WORLD","In addition to critiquing racism, ORourke tried to do something about sexism in the male-dominated world of hacking.","ORourke befriended a 16-year-old California girl who was a regular on TacoLand, and he put her up for membership in the CDC. With Wheelers approval, she got in, making the CDC one of a very few hacker groups of the time that werent all-male.","I joined happily, honored, and proceeded to write crappy, horrific, 16-year-old bloody t-files, Carrie Campbell wrote to friends in the group 20 years later. I loved the community of smart people (and their girlfriends) to converse with and bounce ideas off of. The acceptance of my female gender is extremely rare in the hacker scene and I appreciate itSomehow I ended up purely by accident as the only girl in the worlds most notorious hacker group.","Wheeler kept the Cult of the Dead Cow small, with no more than 20 active members at a time and about 50 over the groups life. It continues today. The vast majority have remained anonymous, though most of the core participants agreed to identify themselves for the forthcoming book, called Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World. Campbell and Wheeler were two of those who agreed to be identified as CDC members for the first time.","During ORourkes active period, we werent deliberately looking for hacking chops, Wheeler said. It was very much about personality and writing, really. For a long time, the test, or evaluation, was to write t-files. Everyone was expected to write things. If we were stoked to have more hacker-oriented people, it was because wed be excited to have a broader range in our t-files.","ORourke wrote a few more essays before entering Columbia in 1991. The introduction of internet service providers and Web browsers in the mid-1990s wiped out most bulletin boards, but the CDC lived on.","Its writing moved to web pages that were hosted for years by a famed Boston hacking collective called the L0pht, with which the CDC shared four members, including Peiter Mudge Zatko, future head of the cyber security mission at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA is the Pentagon skunk works created after Sputnik to create strategic surprise in international conflict, and it had launched the forerunner to todays internet.","ORourke saw other members socially until at least 1997, just as the Cult of the Dead Cow was ramping up a run of five or six years as the most famous group of its kind.","I was really at the margins, but I very much wanted to be as cool as these people, as sophisticated and technologically proficient and aware and smart as they were, he said in the interview. I never was, but it meant so much just being able to be a part of something with themunderstanding how the world worked  literally how it worked, how the phone system worked and how we were all connected to each other.","At the hacker conference Def Con in 1998 and 1999, donning costumes and rapping to a light show, the CDC released two tools to hack into computers running Windows. Back Orifice and its sequel Back Orifice 2000 were condemned as reckless by some. But the idea was to cause enough chaos and scrutiny to force Microsoft to work harder to secure its products, and the stunts worked, company veterans and outside security experts said.","Like ORourke, not everyone in the CDC pursued careers in the computer industry. Wheeler ran music venues in Texas and produced records in New York before turning to currency trading. Campbell is a freelance researcher near Seattle.","When Campbell left the email group for CDC members in 2006, she asked everyone to keep ORourkes identity secret, because he had just been elected to the El Paso city council.","They did so, and a few stepped up in late 2017 and early 2018 to hold some of ORourkes earliest out-of-state fundraisers for the Senate race. The first in San Francisco was co-hosted by CDC member Adam ODonnell, an entrepreneur and a security engineer at Cisco Systems, and Alex Stamos, then the chief security officer at Facebook, who had worked under CDC members at a security provider in the previous decade.","Both said that technology was playing an increasingly fundamental role in national and personal security, the economy and everyday life, and that ORourkes background in the industry, no matter how unconventional, would be a huge advantage in office.","Its really exciting, Stamos said. I have to support this guy, someone who has been active in this world since he was a teenager.","Chris Wysopal, a L0pht veteran who founded tech company Veracode with a friend from the CDC, said he had been happily surprised to hear last year of ORourkes history.","We need people at his level who come from the hacking community and get it, Wysopal said. But its rare to see someone from that background have the leadership and communications skills. Its hard to believe that we might even see a hacker run for president.","Back during one of his college summers, ORourke crashed at Carrie Campbells house when his punk band toured her area. She saw him in 1997, too, when he was working at a New York internet provider and the CDC came to the Hackers on Planet Earth conference.","The next time was two decades later, at a Seattle fundraiser for the Senate race. ORourke singled her out in the crowd and told everyone she was a great person who didnt complain that his band once had eaten all her cereal. But there was one thing he didnt mention: how they met.","(This article is adapted from a forthcoming book by Reuters reporter Joseph Menn: Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World.)","Reported by Joseph Menn.

Ltd. All rights reserved.","This isn't the first time that angry Indians have targeted the wrong app on the Google Play store.","A new advertisement for Surf Excel detergent, which shows a girl dropping her Muslim friend at a mosque to pray on Holi, has drawn a huge amount of flak on social media platforms as being anti-Hindu. And, apart from Facebook and Twitter, the keyboard nationalists have also taken to showing their displeasure by review-bombing Excel on the Google Play store. Not Surf Excel thoughthe negative reviews are turning up on Microsoft Excel.","As of now, the number of negative reviews are still pretty lowbut the controversy has only just started to brew, and this could well grow with time. One of the latest reviews, which gives the app 5 stars, states, I used to like this app, until they partnered with Surf and made such a disgusting anti religious ad. Now where ever I read the word Excel I can only think of anti Hindu propaganda. Shame on you for doing this.","There is, of course, no partnership between Microsoft and Surf. The controversy around the Surf Excel ad is needlessly bizarre, as the advertisement promotes religious harmony and doesnt actually make any negative statement, but logic and rhetoric are often divorced in India.","A one-star rating review is much more direct and to the point. The user writes, boykot sarf excel. hindu birodh hai. pakisthan me ja kar business kar. (Boycott Surf Excel. It is anti-Hindu. Take your business to Pakistan.) Another, coming in late in the day, writes, Ye hindu virodhi hai, meaning this is anti-Hindu.","Another one-star review from earlier on Monday goes into much more detail in Malayalam. The author writes:  ,             .    .  ..","Translated, that roughly means: You traitors, if we put our minds to it youll have to close your Surf Excel business and flee. You dont know Sangh workers. Jai Gaumata.","Now, as we pointed out, its only been a short while since the ad came out and the criticism began, so the number of reviews could rise. And its entirely likely that some of these reviews could have been put up as a joketo parody the nationalist mindset, with phrases like Jai Gaumata sprinkled in.","And on the plus side, while there are some negative reviews, the majority of reviews at this point (coming from users with names that sound to be of Indian origin) for the Excel app are mostly positive, or if negative, then related to the features of the app.","However, this is not the first time that Indians have used app ratings as a means of expressing displeasureand worse, its not even the first time that weve review-bombed the wrong app!","In 2017, a leaked report said that Snapchat CEO Evan Speigel had said that the company didnt plan to expand into India as the country was too poorand Indians were instantly outraged. So much so that many took to Google Play to downrate Snapchat.

The organization has sent some conflicting signals, though, on how it intends to proceed.","Skipper Joe Maddon suggested there was some discussion of potential acquisitions in recent comments, as Gordon Wittenmyer of the Chicago Sun Times writes. Though Wittenmyer reports that there have been no budgetary changes that would support pursuit ofCraig Kimbrel, he indicated that the organization might lookto the waiver wire and explore potential trades to deepen their bullpen.","President of baseball operations Theo Epstein put a somewhat different spin on things in his comments later today. He said that he does not foresee anything significant at all in terms of new acquisitions and added that he is confident in the teams existing depth. (Twitterlinks.)","Itstands to reason that the club will at least look into other possibilities. The Cubs could at a minimum peruse this seasons crop of out-of-options players, as several of those players face uphill battles to make their current rosters.","That said, Chicago isnt exactly teeming with bullpen flexibility. Even if Morrow and Strop open the year on the injured list, the team projects to commit roster spots to at least six veterans who cant be optioned: Mike Montgomery, Steve Cishek, Brad Brach, Brandon Kintzler, Brian Duensing and Tyler Chatwood. Beyond that, while Carl Edwards Jr. can technically be optioned, hes a lock for the Opening Day roster.","Speculatively speaking, perhaps the Cubs would simply part ways with an underperforming veteran if a more affordable bullpen option presented itself. It could also be that an intervening development will open a spot. As it stands, though, the clubs relief corps currently looks like a potentially problematic area that cant be easily addressed.","Chicago Cubs","Comments","Wing Dings Say Wha?","3 weeks ago","Speculatively speaking, perhaps the Cubs would simply part ways with an underperforming veteran if a more affordable bullpen option presented itself... sounds good, so trade Heyward? lol","PixelMelonz","3 weeks ago","Trade Heyward in a salary dump exchange, use open financial room created by trade to pursue Kimbrel?","Chicks Dig the Longball","3 weeks ago","What prospect are you going to attach to Heyward to get any team to take him?","dragqueen","3 weeks ago","Screw a prospectasked 2012 Dodgersany team will take on if the deal is right","iverbure","3 weeks ago","Gotta love the this player suck we should trade him crowd.

I dont think any team would have a problem paying him 30 million dollars over the next 5 years. Thats the only way they would be able to trade him without attaching anybody.

They have maybe 2 pitching prospects. With value. I think both will be called up for a permanent stay by June or July.

Not completely sold on Cedeno, but thats a nice group.","thecoffinnail","3 weeks ago","They already have a very capable closer in Cishek. He was one of the better closers in baseball when he was with the Marlins until he had a bad half a season with them in 2015. After he moved to St. Louis he started finding himself again. Then had a very solid year closing in Seattle. I dont see why the Cubs need to spend closer money on a proven closer with Cishek being more than capable of handling the job. They should have signed Bud Norris to a minors deal. I am sure he would have preferred a contender over the Blue Jays. Casilla is still available and should be ready for a minors pact by now. The last thing the Cubs need is another long term contract for a player getting ready to leave his prime like Kimbrel. Dont get me wrong, Kimbrel will probably remain a solid player for several more seasons. Solid is not elite though and he wants elite money.","ChiSoxCity","3 weeks ago","Cishek is a bandaid.  You cannot win a WS without an elite closer.

In the 365 days since her marriage, Meghan Markle has divided, but has she conquered, asks David Jenkins","By\n                                            Tatler","Its tricky, being Meghan Markle. Even when people are sticking up for you, theyre sticking the knife in you, too. Take Suzanne Moore in The Guardian. She wrote a piece knocking the tabloids for going on about the Duchess of Sussexs habit of cradling her bump, which was decent of her. But, she added, Meghan was not allowed to feel protective of her baby because her job is to breed in captivity. That must have gone down well with the self-proclaimed feminist and activist  who, its true, abandoned her socially conscious online accounts once she got married.","But shes damned if she does, and shes damned if she doesnt. Write stirring messages on bananas for sex workers, and the Daily Mail derides you. Get a Grenfell cookbook published, and there are whispers of disapproval from courtiers. Hang out with the Clooney/Beckham/Soho House set and be assailed for being too Hollywood, for forcing your hen-pecked husband to abandon his old, country-set muckers  including Tom Skippy Inskip, the ultra-loyal, tight-lipped Harry pal, who, its said, advised Harry not to marry Meghan and has paid the price: banishment.","Advertisement","Its been there from the beginning, that criticism. Very shortly after her engagement was announced, I had dinner with some old-fashioned grandees, one of whom has connections with Kensington Palace. Meghan came up in conversation. Shes trouble, said one peer. Im not at all sure its a good thing. The KP-connectee sighed: yes, he said, thats what a few people there felt. Its always the way; courtiers are plus royaliste que le roi  more royalist than the king himself. Remember poor Fergie, aka Sarah, Duchess of York. When she married Prince Andrew, the Queens second son, she, like Meghan, was heralded as a breath of fresh air, a fun-filled redhead whod blow the cobwebs off the monarchy. In the end, Lord Charteris of Amisfield, one-time Private Secretary to the Queen, declared, She is vulgar, vulgar, vulgar, and that is that. Even The Independent wrote that Fergie had exuberantly expensive bad taste, a voracious appetite for publicity and swallowed up large amounts of money.","Meghan has seen nothing like that  even though staff at Kensington Palace are now calling her Me-Gain. And savvy  but well-informed and well-connected  outsiders feel shes getting bad advice. And that that advice comes not from palace regulars, but from Meghans own connections. Connections who are blamed for Meghans apparent decision to let friends brief People magazine about her direrelations with her father, her hand in writing Harrys speeches, her nail polish, her cooking and her trust in God. Eyebrows rose even higher during her luxurious New York trip and the Marie Antoinette overtones of her baby shower,  which included four Ladure macaron towers costing $350 each. She needs some pros, said an image-business source, because the advice shes been getting is crap. He paused, then added, Which is odd. Ive met her two or three times, and shes quite a pro. She knows exactly what she wants. But shes almost dealing with everything herself, and thats dangerous.","Read next","Charles, William and Harry attend the premiere of Attenboroughs Our Planet","A royal night out","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","All this wont go down well with her new husband. Harrys a proud man, said one insider, and a sensitive man. Hed be very upset at the idea of people criticising his wife. Hes utterly besotted. This upset is, of course, reflected in the couples notorious Christmas card: black and white, their backs to the viewer, arms around each other, the sky alive with fireworks which you could, if you wished to, construe as shellfire. Was it meant to be arty, or cool, unlike the bland happy-families shot sent by William and Catherine? Was it a proclamation of us-against-the-world, as many body language experts claimed? The photograph was taken on the couples wedding day, a day of unalloyed triumph, a day of radiance, a day of happiness, after what Prince Charles told one source was the nightmare of the wedding preparations.","Advertisement","Utterly besotted is spot on. (Palace denizens, who used to favour Harry over the petulant William, now complain that its impossible ever to catch the Duke of Sussexs eye; hes always gazing, cow-eyed with devotion, at his wife.) And the besottedness was clearly immediate. Violet von Westenholz brought the couple together, and two dates later Harry whisked Meghan off to Botswana where, he said, We camped out with each other under the stars, sharing a tent and all that stuff. It was fantastic. That was in August 2016; look at Harry looking at Meghan, and its clear that nothings changed.","Alas, nothing much has changed with the press, either. Come 8 November 2016, and Prince Harrys Communications Secretary issued an extraordinary statement: This past week, it said, has seen a line crossed. His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public  the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racist undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. Some of this has been hidden... It went on to talk of Meghans mother, Doria Ragland, having to struggle past photographers and the attempts of reporters and photographers to gain illegal entry to her home.","Read next","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have officially moved to Windsor","Frogmore Cottage becomes home for the Sussexes","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Unprecedented, that. But applauded, in most quarters  though the statement was released as the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were on an official tour of the Middle East; Clarence House cant have been best pleased that its timing knocked their engagements into the back pages. Still, the brouhaha gave good reason for Meghan to consider whether her prince was worth the destruction of her privacy. Its one thing to be an ambitious actress playing the PR game; quite another to be en route to a wedding with a worldwide audience of 1.9 billion.","Advertisement","But on the couple sailed. There was gossip  of course there was. That Prince Charles had met Meghan, been fascinated by her, but told a friend, I just hope he doesnt marry her; that later, admiringly yet overwhelmedly, he compared her to tungsten, conjuring up that metal to describe her strength of character. That Harry could barely keep his hands off her at Skippys wedding in Jamaica in March 2017. All well and good. We loved it. But one Hollywood friend of mine shook his head and said, Shes a piece of work, which, in LA terms, is not a compliment. Her website, The Tig (for Tignanello, an Italian wine), was scoured for insights: running around a city and trying to get into clubs wearing headbands of the phallic persuasion on a hen night, she wrote, would not be on brand; another post read everything tastes better with a little hot sauce. She was, it became clear, big on homeopathic medicine and holistic remedies. And, she told another blog, I learned [on film sets] how happy people would be when I walked in with a tray of perfect crudits  a forerunner, perhaps, of the ice-cream and sorbet stand friends told People magazine shed bought for her office at Kensington Palace: I came by one day, the friend reported, and they [the staff] were remarking how it was the best day of work ever. Love was in the air. Her ex-husband, very properly, kept his counsel. But...","Well, Gina Nelthorpe Cowne, a former agent of the duchess, noticed a difference in late 2016. She met her in 2014 when Meghan was enthusiastic about working with the Young World Conference, a youth summit that aimed to inspire 18- to 30-year-olds, and an enterprise that Nelthorpe Cowne was dealing with. She calls Meghan a really warm and genuine person who is ferociously intelligent and who was interested in humanitarian and philanthropic causes  and in animal rights issues too, but her main focus was and I believe still is, womens rights. She wanted to be recognised as a humanitarian.","The two worked closely together, and warmly, until September 2016 when there was a big change. She did give me a difficult time. Meghan snapped at a young reporter: she complained about being asked to move seats in a first-class lounge to make way for a group of male Colombian dignitaries. Nelthorpe Cowne got the feeling that, it was as if this would be the last time anyone would ever ask her to move again. And that, roughly, was that: in October, Meghan wrote her a lovely email, saying she was giving up her career and we had to terminate our contract. Remarkable to be so sure, just four months after she and Harry met. Not just made of tungsten, but possessed of a crystal ball as well.","Here on in, then, there are two eras. Love, love, love from the public  and the press  up to and including the wedding. Her half-sister, the nightmarish Samantha Markle was, and is, exactly that: a nightmare. Her father, Thomas, also didnt cover himself in glory but... Why didnt the palace take him in hand? Why wasnt he showered with affection and inclusivity? What was, and is, going on? Its strange not to have any member of your family at the wedding, bar Doria, your lovely and dignified mother  providing, by the by, an excellent PR opportunity for the Prince ofWales to conduct himself really, really well with Ms Ragland. (Speaking of awkward relatives: dont forget that Kate Middleton still had her scapegrace Uncle Gary to her wedding.) It was clever, too, of the Archbishop of Canterbury to suggest the loquacious Bishop Michael Curry to give the address, and shrewd of Prince Charles to propose The Kingdom Choir for a rendition of Stand By Me. (Incidentally, the Archbishop met his Old Etonian chum, Matt Ridley, at Euston station the Wednesday before the wedding. How was he, asked Ridley. Ill be fine after Saturday, was the reply. Whats happening on Saturday? asked Ridley, proving that not everyone was gripped by events.)","Read next","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex launch their own Instagram account","...gaining over 50k followers in under 15 minutes","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Ridley was among those at a lunch given that week by a national newspaper editor, at which the host shared his guesstimate about Meghan-Harry: after five years and two children, shed take them to California to see their grandmother  and file for divorce. This wasnt an uncommon topic. Great, obviously, to meet someone who adores you, but wouldnt Meghan chafe? Fine to show up, as she did, in Roland Mouret to the concert for Sentebale, Harrys HIV charity, and to sit near hedge funder Ian Wace; but how will a ferociously intelligent woman pursue her more controversial concerns? As simply a Suits star, shed have been sure to diss Trump. As a royal, thats verboten. Could she join the Womens March? Shed want to, but anything plainly political is, again, out of the question for a royal. And Harry, for all his big-heartedness, is no intellectual.","She made a gesture of embracing Harrys country side, but did it her way, going out on an aristo shoot in jeans and a jumper, toting a gun but not firing it  didnt care or try too hard, adds the source. She also isnt interested in being girlie/fluffy/having silly chats with the Sloanes. Separated herself a bit.","The separated herself a bit comment is telling. Harry is now less in with his old Gloucestershire set than he used to be. Although Skippy was invited to the couples wedding, alongside many of Harrys old friends he was edged out of the reception at Frogmore House in favour of big celebrities. Both Harry and Meghan attended the Daisy Jenks-Charlie van Straubenzee wedding, but they also  eyebrow-raisingly  went to the three-day-long launch of Soho House Amsterdam. (Meghan, of course, held her hen party at Soho Farmhouse, near the couples cottage in Great Tew.)","The Amsterdam bash took place the weekend one of their wedding guests, Sophie Carter, married Robert Snuggs in Norfolk. William and Kate were there, Sophie being one of Princess Charlottes godparents. I dont know which party Id have preferred, but Soho House was definitely new Harry  fan of the stars and aromatherapy devotee. Fun had already been had with the mixing of Goop/yoga-oriented Meghan with shotsnwellies Harry. The Mail on Sunday ran an April Fool piece, claiming that his stag weekend was to include yurts, yoga, laverbread smoothies and predawn Celtic chanting in a blue stone circle in the Brecon Beacons. And lo, it has come to pass, as we know from Harrys enthusing to a crowd in Birkenhead about the benefits of yoga.","Read next","Meet Italian millionaire Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi: Princess Beatrice's new boyfriend","The Italian property tycoon who's swept the princess off her feet","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Kate probably does yoga, too. But that, its said, seems to be the limit of her and Meghans shared interests. Everyone knows Katewas reduced to tears by Meghans brusqueness to her daughter, Charlotte. And everyone knows that Harry upbraided William for what he felt was the Cambridges lukewarm embrace of Meghan. And everyone has their own views on whether the Cambridges did or did not have a prior engagement when Prince Charles invited them and the Sussexes to Scotland. And everyones got a mental image of the moment when Meghan will for the first time have to curtsey to Kate, when Kate becomes Queen, as protocol dictates. Itll make having to wear nude stockings seem a breeze.","But Meghans glamour must be a hard pill for Kate to swallow, too. Its not as though Kate and William were not in love when they married. But theirs had been a 10-year courtship, with ups, downs and even break-ups. So the remarkableness of Kate was... well, not entirely remarked on. She was, after all, a commoner, the first ever to marry a future King. (Edward VIII renounced the throne to marry the commoner and divorcee that Mrs Simpson was.) But Kate had learnt to play the royal game. Almost too well. She hasnt put a foot wrong, but she has, in truth, played it safe. Not for Kate the likes of a56,000 Ralph & Russo gown when she was photographed for Vogue; instead, she wore a 24 top from Petit Bateau. Not for her the expensive clothes that Meghan wears, perhaps paid for by Meghan, perhaps by the Prince of Wales. Which, indeed, leads one shrewd observer to ask, Wheres the wonga going to come from when Charles is King? Itll be William wholl be handing out the Duchy money then. Thatll be interesting.","It will. William wasnt thrilled to be ticked off about his attitude towards Meghan. And Harry, some say, was not thrilled when William advised him against rushing into marriage. Williams a prickly character, and Harrys hot-headed. And, as can be seen from his what Meghan wants, Meghan gets outburst, hell fight his wifes corner fiercely. Was the tiara at the centre of that tantrum already promised to Princess Eugenie for her wedding, as some believe? (Harry and Meghan, dont forget, queue-barged their way into the first Windsor wedding of 2018.) And did the Queen veto Meghans plans for a sleeveless wedding dress? The rumours may be false, but not as false as the speculation Meghan was pregnant on her wedding day  thats why the dress was so baggy, one young woman assured me  and certainly not as false as the rumour that theirs is an IVF baby.","But its rumours like that, and the drip, drip, drip of stories about aides leaving Meghans employ and servants being upset by her manner, that are making their lives such a misery. The Prince of Wales enthusiasm for his daughter-in-law is being ignored, as is Meghans role as the catalyst for a new warmth between Harry and his father. People whove lunched with her have loved her; shes beautiful; shes clever; shes made Harry happy. Whats not to like?","Advertisement","But are they happy as a couple? Harrys circle has narrowed, and Meghan has shown how stung shes been by letting her friends defend her in People magazine. George Clooney has stood up for her, invoking what happened to Diana, Princess of Wales as a warning. And its tough when her make-up chum, Daniel Martin, posts a picture of the tea she had laid out for him  avocado on toast, chocolates  and the line,  Thank you Meghan for being the consummate hostess this weekend and still being the #avocadotoastwhisperer, and posh noses sniff; its just not on, they say  what sort of person is she having around? Meghan wants a doula; cue mockery. Even though Britain has ten times more interracial relationships than the rest of Europe, according to a study quoted by Afua Hirsch, author of Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging, some of the antipathy must be racist, as it was of the biracial President Obama. Which is hard to stomach. Some of it is anti-American, in the mocking Gwyneth Paltrow dynamic-5am-email sense. Some of itis captured in the Daily Express headline Loving... but dominating. Some of it reflects sadness at the passing of the Jack the Lad Harry, the roguish Harry, the roistering Harry, in favour of a more sober, duller version.","And some of it is... some of it is the fact that people love a good gossip. Love to hear that the Clooneys, sitting next to John and Lady Carolyn Warren at the wedding, were bickering in the choir stalls. Love to think that there are duchessly handbags at dawn. Not nice at all if youre the subject of it. And not nice when youre pregnant in a foreign land, and not at all sure that royal insiders are on your side. Yes, its tricky, being Meghan Markle.","This piece was originally published in the May issue.","Share this article","Recommended","The best of the BAFTAs on Bystander: years of parties, after-parties and dinners","Featuring Lily James, Matt Smith, Ralph Fiennes and more","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Bystander","Travel","Luxury hotels celebrating milestone anniversaries in 2019","Decades of five-star experiences","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Elle Blakeman","Jewellery Month","Best jewellery moments of the year","Including highlights from the Oscars, Cannes and the MET ball","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Bystander","Royals","As the Queen marks 67 years on the throne, what does this year hold?","She's just shy of her Platinum Jubilee","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Victoria Murphy"],"targetCaptions":[]}

According to  research from McKinsey, nearly one-third of U.S. workers will need to find new jobs by 2030 in response to automation and rapid advancements in technology.

Anybody can learn to be a good writer,\" Gates says in an accompanying video interview. \"It may be harder for some people, but that means you put your shoulder against it and you have some grit and you stick with it.\"","Gates acknowledges that emerging sectors such as robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are already affecting the types of jobs that are available. In light of this, she says that gaining expertise in new industries will be the deciding factor in your ability to maintain a successful career.","\"If you're going to switch jobs, getting a little bit of training  will help you with that,\" Gates explains. \"It'll not only help you with the confidence, it'll help you with the skills.\"","In recent years, there's been an increased focus on skills-based training programs as companies look to bolster their tech teams, including IBM. CEO Ginni Rometty announced in 2016 that the company was making a concerted effort to hire workers based on their skills, as opposed to their credentials, such as whether they attended a traditional four-year college.","\"As industries transform,\" she wrote in a  USA Today column, \"jobs are being created that demand new skills  which in turn requires new approaches to education, training and recruiting.\"","However, Gates says that a typical four-year liberal arts education will always have a place in the job economy because it teaches students about curiosity, learning and how to face problems. She adds that while certain jobs, particularly those in tech, will require specific skills, other roles will require things like people skills, so having that educational background in terms of how you think, question and analyze will always be important.","The billionaire leaves workers of the future with this word of advice on learning new skills: \"You can absolutely do it.

But a faltering economy or giant scandal could change everything.","By BEN WHITE and STEVEN SHEPARD","03/21/2019 05:02 AM EDT","President Donald Trump has a low approval rating. He is engaging in bitter Twitter wars and facing metastasizing investigations.","But if the election were held today, hed likely ride to a second term in a huge landslide, according to multiple economic models with strong track records of picking presidential winners and losses.","Story Continued Below","Credit a strong U.S. economy featuring low unemployment, rising wages and low gas prices  along with the historic advantage held by incumbent presidents.","While Trump appears to be in a much stronger position than his approval rating and conventional Beltway wisdom might suggest, he also could wind up in trouble if the economy slows markedly between now and next fall, as many analysts predict it will.","And other legal bombshells could explode the current scenario. Trumps party managed to lose the House in 2018 despite a strong economy. So the models could wind up wrong this time around.","COUNTDOWN TO 2020","The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

I just dont see how the blue wall could resist all that.","Models maintained by economists and market strategists like Luskin tend to ignore election polls and personal characteristics of candidates. Instead, they begin with historical trends and then build in key economic data including growth rates, wages, unemployment, inflation and gas prices to predict voting behavior and election outcomes.","Yale economist Ray Fair, who pioneered this kind of modeling, also shows Trump winning by a fair margin in 2020 based on the economy and the advantage of incumbency.","Even if you have a mediocre but not great economy  and thats more or less consensus for between now and the election  that has a Trump victory and by a not-trivial margin, winning 54 percent of the popular vote to 46 for the Democrat, he said. Fairs model also predicted a Trump win in 2016 though it missed on Trumps share of the popular vote.","Still, Luskin, Fair and other analysts who use economic data and voting history to make predictions also note that a sharp decline in growth and an increase in the unemployment rate by next fall could alter Trumps fortunes.","2020 Elections","ORourkes sprint out of the gate leaves Democratic field gasping","By DAVID SIDERS and CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO","It would have to slow a lot to still be not pretty good, Luskin said, adding that what really matters is the pace of change. Even if overall numbers remain fairly strong, a sharp move in the wrong direction could alter voting behavior.","Luskins current model  which looks at GDP growth, gas prices, inflation, disposable income, tax burden and payrolls  has Trump winning by a blowout margin of 294 electoral votes.","The White House remains confident that the GOP tax cut will support growth of 3 percent both this year and next, keeping job and wage gains strong. Thats much higher than consensus forecasts from the Federal Reserve and major banks that generally see a global slowdown led by Europe and China, coupled with the fading impact of U.S. tax cuts pushing U.S. growth closer to 2 percent this year with job gains slowing.","But Trump may have one major ally in his quest to make sure the numbers dont go much lower than this: the Fed, which recently stopped its campaign of interest rate hikes. And on Wednesday the central bank said it foresees no more rate hikes this year.","The moves followed months of Trump bashing the Fed for raising rates too much and stomping on his economy, though Chairman Jerome Powell has said repeatedly that politics plays no role in the banks decision.","Whatever the case, a much more gentle Fed could slide a floor beneath any decline in Trumps economy and boost his reelection chances significantly.","Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics and a regular Trump critic, has been road-testing a dozen different economic models for the 2020 race. At this point, Trump wins in all 12  and quite comfortably in most of them. The Moodys models look at economic trends at the state level.","If the election were held today, Trump would win according to the models and pretty handily, Zandi said. In three or four of them it would be pretty close. Hes got low gas prices, low unemployment and a lot of other political variables at his back. The only exception is his popularity, which matters a lot. If that falls off a cliff it would make a big difference. The Moodys models look at economic trends at the state level and incorporate some political variables including a president's approval rating.","The Moodys approach performed well in recent presidential elections, but missed the 2016 result in part because it did not account for a potential drop in Democratic turnout in key swing states. Zandi is trying to correct for that now before rolling out a new model sometime this summer.","2020 elections","Klobuchars senator next door strategy collides with Betomania","By ELENA SCHNEIDER","Trump has already upended many of the rules of presidential politics. His party suffered a drubbing in last years midterm elections despite the strong economy, and the yawning gap between how voters view the president and the nations economic standing is growing even larger: Presidents typically just arent this unpopular when the economic engine is humming along.","Trump this week seized on a new CNN poll that showed more than seven in 10 Americans, or 71 percent, view the U.S. economy as very good or somewhat good. That was higher than CNN has measured at any point since a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in Feb. 2001 found 80 percent thought the economy was that robust.","Yet Trumps approval rating in the poll  which is usually tied closely to the economy  is just 42 percent. And unlike during the late 90s, when President Bill Clintons approval ratings surged ahead of his personal favorability amid major scandal, Trumps favorable ratings (41 percent in the CNN poll) track closely with his job-approval rating.","Those low scores also apply to many attributes typically seen as desirable in presidents. Just 40 percent say Trump cares about people like them; 34 percent say he is honest and trustworthy; 41 percent say he can manage the government effectively; and 32 percent say he will unite the country, not divide it.","Moreover, even how Americans view the state of the country has become divorced from the economy. In the latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, only 36 percent of voters said the U.S. was headed in the right direction, compared with nearly two-thirds, 64 percent, who said it was off on the wrong track.","For the economic models to be correct, voters would have to shrug off much of what they dislike about Trump and decide the strength of the economy makes a change unwise.","Prominent Democrats know that while Trump might seem like a loose cannon faced with the threat of a devastating report from special counsel Robert Mueller, he will likely be a formidable opponent in 2020, especially if the economy remains close to where it is today.","Despite the fact that Trump is a largely incompetent clown, Democrats should not be overly confident or sanguine that they can beat him, said Dan Pfeiffer, a top aide to former President Barack Obama. He is a slight favorite to win. But he barely won last time and it took a Black Swan series of events to make that happen. All Democrats have to do is flip 100,000 or so votes in three states to win and thats a very doable thing.","This article tagged under:","Missing out on the latest scoops?

Sometimes, he even takes care of them.","The issue of his family came to the fore on Thursday when ORourke told a crowd that his wife, Amy Sanders ORourke, was raising their kids sometimes with my help.","Beto tells a coffee shop crowd that he just talked with his wife, Amy. She is raising, sometimes with my help, their three kids. Then says hes running for president for his kids, and theirs.","The comment, some said, was meant as self-deprecation and an acknowledgment of the hard work Amy ORourke did for their family. But despite his intentions, Beto ORourke revealed a fundamental inequality of American life: While men throughout history have been able to rely on their wives to provide child care while they fulfill their political ambitions, women have rarely been able to count on partners to do the same. And as New York Magazine writer Rebecca Traister pointed out, a woman who joked about being a part-time parent while on the campaign trail would be harshly criticized  and might find her political career over before it began.","Being a sometimes parent is a luxury many female candidates dont have","The ORourkes have three children: Henry, 8, Molly, 10, and Ulysses, 12. Their child care arrangements arent entirely clear (Beto ORourke has not yet responded to Voxs request for comment), but ORourke has certainly spent time away from his family recently, as he traveled the country deciding whether to run for president.","Jack Kerouac-style, he roams around, jobless (does he not need a job?) to find himself and figure out if he wants to lead the free world, Nia-Malika Henderson wrote at CNN in January, during what she called Beto ORourkes excellent adventure. This is a luxury no woman or even minority in politics could ever have.","One reason a Jack Kerouac-style journey would be difficult for many women: Moms, on average, still spend more time on child care than dads do. And mothers still face the widespread expectation that theyll be the primary caregivers for their kids.","A dad who jokes about being a sometimes parent might get some criticism on Twitter, but hell also get knowing laughs from people who are used to seeing moms as the ones in charge of kids. A mom who makes the same joke  well, shes just a bad mom!","In a recent Vanity Fair profile by Joe Hagan, Amy ORourke objected to Hendersons CNN piece  I was a little insulted because it implied that I couldnt support our family. (She is the director of an education-focused nonprofit.) The profile included several photographs, taken by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz, of Beto ORourke playing music, making pancakes, and otherwise hanging out with his kids. Its also worth noting that Amy ORourke comes from a wealthy family, and she and her husband may be able to afford child care help while he campaigns.","But Hagans story also included this anecdote from a recent plane trip taken by the ORourkes:","Amy was reading Becoming, by Michelle Obama, absorbing the former First Ladys account of her trials living through a toxic presidential race with her husband. By the time the ORourkes touched down at El Paso International Airport, Amys stomach was in knots. She was kind of pissed at me when we got home, recalls ORourke. Almost like You fucker.","She knew he was running.","Whether its Michelle Obama or, now, Amy ORourke, wives have long had to manage the home front while their husbands go out campaigning  and those husbands have been able to focus their energy on politics, knowing the kids are being taken care of.","Its a freedom many female politicians dont have. Take Liuba Grechen Shirley, a Democrat who ran for Congress in New York in 2018 (she failed to unseat Republican Pete King, a 25-year incumbent). Shirley and her husband, who works full time, have two young children, and Shirley got Federal Election Commission approval to use campaign funds to pay for child care, becoming the first woman to do so.","For the first six months of our campaign, I had my children with me every day until 3:30, she told Vox in November. I would literally be making phone calls, Id be at meetings with a baby strapped to my chest.","In January, she launched Vote Mama, the first political action committee to fund mothers of young children running for office.","Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has made universal child care part of her campaign platform for 2020. ORourke has yet to announce a position on child care.","Child care responsibilities may affect whether women run for office  political scientists Jennifer Lawless and Richard Fox have found that as womens household responsibilities decrease, their interest in running increases (the same was not true for men). Its a relatively slight effect, but as Lawless and Fox notes, household duties might also affect how women run if they decide to do so  they quote gender politics scholar Georgia Duerst-Lahti, who says, Women may now think about running for office, but they probably think about it while they are making the bed.","For many mothers, sometimes parenting isnt an option. And while Beto ORourkes comment did draw attention to everything his wife does to support his campaign, it was also a reminder of the privileges many male candidates have that women dont  in particular, the privilege of a partner who takes the lead in caring for your kids, and a society that accepts that as normal.","Next Up In\n    \n        Politics & Policy","Most Read","Vox Sentences","The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.","The Latest","Why Crazy Ex-Girlfriends series finale was so, so satisfying","Vox Sentences: A Saudi crackdown on womens rights","America is finally being exposed to the devastating reality of prison violence","Mark Halperin says his conduct has changed.

Roland Guelle, CTO of Berlin & Cologne-based Sevenval Technologies, presents seven trends that are important today and in the future.","Everything goes front end. This was Roland Guelles conclusion when asked about the front end development trends of 2018 in the Sevenval company blog about a year ago.","One year later, we asked him again and today, Roland Guelle presents seven tangible front-end development trends that will pick up speed in 2019:","Front End Leaves 2D","The front end is the interface between people and the digital world. Traditionally, we operate via mouse and keyboard on a desktop computer, today more frequently, via touchscreen on mobile devices. Traditionally, we work with fat-clients  i.e. software that runs completely on the users device  whereas today we often work with web applications. The front end is therefore increasingly leaving the traditional two-dimensional space and is operated via voice assistants, gesture control, applications for augmented as well as virtual reality and new 3D interfaces. This trend will continue in 2019 and could also be seen in last years Christmas trend: After millions of newly bought Alexa assistants were started around the world on Christmas day, Amazon ended up struggling with serious server issues and outages because of the millions of new Alexa assistants.","Data Driven Product Management","There are also new possibilities for data-driven product management. In 2019, work with MVPs, agile methodologies and big data will strongly influence the way products are designed and developed. More than ever before, decision making will be based on data, rather than gut feeling. This will help to develop new services and products in a lean and focused way.","Machine Learning For UX Optimization","Increasinly, machine learning-based approaches will be used to better understand how applications are actually utilized in order to optimize the user experience. Instead of using classic A/B testing to examine individual elements, such as menus, self-learning systems will be able to automatically adapt. The digital behavior of the individual user will become the most important foundation for designing apps according to these requirements. As a result, a navigation service can show the user the best route to the office immediately after the app has been launched  if the app has learned on which days, at what time and by which means of transport the user is heading for which locations. These are usability optimizations providing users with real added value.","Blockchain For Serious Applications","Nowadays when you hear the word blockchain, most automatically think of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is probably the best-known application for blockchain technology but 2018 was a tough year for it: at the beginning of the year, one Bitcoin was worth over 10,000 euros. At the end of the year, the price was a little over 3,000 euros. But blockchain is primarily a decentralized database system and can be used for much more than just currencies. In 2019, private blockchains will also become more widespread and DLT will play an important role. After the hype for use cases in supply chain management and the Internet of Things, the technology will be used to generate real added value.","Web As Ubiquitous Application Framework","Apps are dead  said Sevenval CEO Jan Webering ten years ago. He was right. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), WebVR, nodeJS, React Native and other new technologies make the Web the Ubiquitous Application Framework: fit for all devices, all environments, and all application scenarios. This is very helpful for the providers of digital services, as they do not have to develop and maintain multiple tracks of native code for various devices. This trend will continue to accelerate in 2019.","Debugging In Production","The rule for a long time was: high test coverage, staging and then a clean production. Directly debugging in production systems? That was frowned upon. In times of microservices and distributed systems, the test coverage of each individual application remains very important. Nevertheless, the independence of the service landscape comes at the price of a higher complexity of the overall system. It will be increasingly difficult to recognize problems that exist in the overall system, but cannot be linked to a single service. The detailed monitoring of the core KPIs and the possibility of debugging in the production system without endangering stability and security are important building blocks for good development results in 2019.","Web Security In The Client","Can security be a trend? Yes, because 2019 is the year in which conventional browsers will take giant steps towards an app environment. Google has been leading the way with ChromeOS for a long time: The entire operating system is, first of all, a browser that brings web applications to the device. And this gives way to entirely new attack vectors, where the focus is no longer on individual servers or the corporate infrastructure, but primarily on users themselves. This trend will inevitably lead to a rethinking of security on client side.","And Even More Trends ","Check your SEO with Ryte for FREE","Start now!","Published on 03/26/2019 by Roland Guelle.","Roland Guelle","As CTO of Sevenval Technologies GmbH, founded in 1999, Roland Guelle is responsible for research and development.

Because [Former coach] Adam [Gases] first year here we went 10-6 and right when [Tannehill] got hurt he was playing really good, that stretch of about six or seven games. So it was his first time with Adam and working with Adam.","Him going down in training camp the following year (2017) and then last season up and down so ... I dont think, because after that 10-6 year with Adam you thought now its going to turn and its going to be what people hoped it would be as far as being a top 10 pick in the draft. The expectations are always, when youre picked that high, through the roof.","Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month","Get full access to Miami Herald content across all your devices.","And I think ... No, I dont think it was a mistake.","And now its time for a little concern. Because whatever you think of Tannehill -- good, bad or indifferent -- it is obvious he is history in the rear view mirror. So litigating his positives and negatives is folly.","But the topic is important here because Grier was part of the decision-making process on Tannehill the past three years. And now hes leading the Dolphins expedition across the dangerous draft minefield the next couple of years to find a new quarterback.","And by his own admission, finding a franchise quarterback is the unquestioned, top priority of that mission.","But how can we have high confidence the looming search for a quarterback wont be plagued by mistakes when the man leading that search doesnt think the Tannehill years were a mistake? And lets be clear, they were a mistake.","Everyone knows this.","I hope Grier, as a big proponent of Nick Saban, recognizes this is a problem. Because one of Sabans favorite credos is that, The best predictor of future behavior is past performance.","And the Dolphins past with Tannehill was, without doubt, lacking foresight and vision. And if Grier cannot readily see this, that is not good.","A front office with vision might have worried about Tannehill in the spring of 2017 after the quarterback chose to not have surgery to repair a torn ACL and his backup Matt Moore was by the teams own admission not capable of filling the void if one came up. Yet the Dolphins, dealing with uncertainty with two quarterbacks, did nothing in the 2017 draft to find a suitable quarterback addition of note.","I think the one thing we could have all done, and me pushing too, was drafting someone behind him to come through, Grier admitted. So looking back, maybe we could have, but we had other needs so, you know, it was kind of a different mindset in the way we were doing things.","There are some players there that we liked a lot and what we were looking for. But we also werent willing to mortgage the future at that time, in terms of working with Adam and going through the process. Patrick Mahomes? We liked Patrick Mahomes. I would say we probably didnt spend a ton of time with him. But we met with him briefly, spent some time. Our guys who went on school visits liked him. Very talented player. As far as the other quarterbacks, they were all talented players but at that time, we werent willing to give up a couple first-round picks to move up at that point.","Fine, so lets excuse the Dolphins for not seeing the whole playing field after 2016 and missing on both Mahomes and DeShaun Watson in the 17 draft. I can understand it. But after a 2017 season in which Tannehill again blew out his knee, there was again no grand urgency to draft a quarterback in 2018...","...While the Jets traded up to draft a quarterback in the first round.","...While the Bills, picking behind the Dolphins in the first round, vaulted over Miami to draft a quarterback in the first round.","That was the tipping point. That was the critical hour for the Dolphins to replace Tannehill and failing to do so was a mistake that ultimately cost Adam Gase and Mike Tannenbaum their jobs.","So that wasnt a mistake?","After a 2018 season in which Tannehill was clearly inconsistent and obviously not the right guy, the Dolphins new coaching staff did a two-week study on Tannehill. Grier did not tell them what he thought of Tannehill until the study was complete. And then the decision to move on from Tannehill was made.","It was an organizational one, Grier said. Im not going to say who this way or that way. But all of us we talked through it and at the end of the day we all thought that was the right move for the Dolphins going forward.","This frustrates me because I want the Dolphins to succeed. I really do. I want to believe they will.","But for that to happen the decision-making that seems obvious to fans in the stands should always be old news at Dolphins headquarters. The Dolphins should know more about football than you and me. And on this Tannehill issue, the opposite seems true.","Amateur general managers and arm-chair coaches in the stands knew Tannehill was not it before the professional team did.","Grier on Monday said the quarterback position is one you can never be satisfied in until you have the guy you really feel can give you a chance to win a championship.","Did he feel Tannehill could win a championship after 2017? Really?","The chase will soon begin for Miamis next franchise quarterback -- someone who might actually lead the team to some postseason success. And Grier is open to the process he will lead.","I would say that all options are on the table for us, he said. Like I said, it always has to be the right guy, in terms of personality, leadership skills, what youre asking him to do in terms of, is he going to fit with [offensive coordinator] Chad [OShea] and [head coach} Brian [Flores] believe in? So again, its going to be a lot of time here in the spring, getting to know a lot of these kids to determine if thats who Chad and Brian and myself all believe is the right guy to lead us into the future.","And might that mean drafting someone this year and next year?","Yes, Grier said.","Im all for that. Draft one until you get it right.","But, that assumes, the Dolphins will be able to identify when theyve made a mistake.","Related stories from  Miami Herald","miami-dolphins","How concerned are the Dolphins about the long-term health of Xavien Howards knees?","miami-dolphins","Robert Quinn trade update: Dolphins can keep him on their roster  if we have to","miami-dolphins","No tanks!

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. For an explanation of our Advertising Policy, visit this page.","Were partnering with Capital One on ourPurposeful Travel Hub. If you have unique ways you like to give back when you travel or just love exploring new places with family and friends, we want to hearabout it. Shareyour most treasured travel moments and purposeful travel tips with us using #MeaningfulMoments.","There are plenty of reasons you should travel. You get to experience new cultures, step out of your comfort zone, and become a better global citizen. But, if theres one time in particular you should make it a point to travel, its before a major life event.","Vacation and travel are designed to be a rest, break or variation from our normal lives, Lindsay Henderson, a psychologist who treats patients virtually via the telehealth app, LiveHealth Online, told The Points Guy. This can be particularly valuable around periods of transition in life, as travel allows for the time and space to reflect and recharge. It can also contribute to personal growth and development that we need and crave during times of transition.","After all, theres a reason things like honeymoons and babymoons exist. Major life changes come with a lot of excitement and positive anticipation. But, they also come with a lot of stress and anxiety. Having a child, graduating from college (or seeing your kids off to school), and getting married: These are all moments that alter your life tremendously. And its for that very reason you should consider taking a trip before those milestones.","And no, you dont have to empty your savings account (or cash out all your points) for one of these benchmark getaways. The important thing about your trip, even if its a short drive from home or an inexpensive weekend away, is that you take time to relax, unwind and reflect on whatever change is coming your way.","1. Before Having a Baby","Babymoons have become incredibly popular recently (think: the Bahamas in January, or Hawaii in May). After all, who wouldnt want to get away and rest up before the months of sleepless nights ahead? But, more than enjoying some downtime before the chaos, its also a chance to focus on yourself and your relationship.","When you have a baby, your life changes dramatically, Jenn Mann, author of The Relationship Fix, told TPG. Particularly when it comes to babies and women, your whole life focus changes, especially for a first baby. When you go from being single or a couple to being a [parent], you spend the first three years focusing on the needs of this little being, and not yourself. A babymoon is an opportunity to have a last hurrah of that life, and it puts gasoline in the tank of your romantic life with your partner to make it through the rough times.","2. After Graduating From School","Backpacking through Europe after finishing college is almost a rite of passage at this point. Why? That time is some of the most pivotal in anyones life.","It is rare to have the luxury of time once entering the workforce, said Henderson. So, there may be no better opportunity to spend several weeks backpacking around Europe or Asia than after college graduation. Taking in the sights, sounds and experiences of the places you adventure to are critical for getting the most of travel, for having the travel shape who you are as a person and how you interact with the world around you moving forward.","Mann added, When youre in college, youre discovering autonomy, mastery and independence. Traveling only enhances those skills and abilities.","3. Before Starting a New Job","Its been dubbed the jobbymoon, and its that time between jobs when you decide to take a trip. And, according to Mann, its a great idea. Its so rare these days to have time where you have few or no obligations, she said. So, in between jobs when youre relieved of those demands and day-to-day stress, its a great opportunity to travel  if you can afford it  before jumping right into the next gig.","Plus, sometimes being in between jobs isnt always a choice. If you were let go, taking a trip is still a good idea. It turns a negative into a positive, said Mann. You now have positive memories associated with the job loss [rather] than negative ones.","4. When Youre Getting Married","Weddings are a lot of fun. Theyre also a lot of work. After all, there are invitations, bands, family requests and floral arrangements to worry about. Sometimes, obsessing over the details of the wedding can actually throw you off from remembering the reason why youre getting hitched in the first place. What better way to be reminded of that than by taking a little getaway before walking down the aisle with your partner to disconnect from the marital madness and reconnect with each other?","Wedding planning is incredibly stressful, and most people dont realize how stressful it is, said Mann. Its one of those things where stepping away puts things in perspective, which is a real positive. It gives you time to focus on the connection instead of the planning.","Plus, we can think of at least one celeb who kickstarted the trend. So, you know its a good idea.","Of course, theres nothing wrong with the traditional post-wedding honeymoon. Although honeymoons have been around for a while, the reasoning for taking one has shifted slightly. It used to be a trip you took with your significant other to mark the first overnights together. Now, as modern couples often travel and live together prior to their wedding day, its more about recovering from the stress of the planning process. And thats important.","Many couples may feel that their wedding is more about others than it is about them, said Henderson. A honeymoon can serve as the perfect [antidote] to that; an opportunity to relax in a way that is all about the newlyweds and what they want. It is also a chance to reflect together and mark the start of your new life as a married couple. Remember: A honeymoon is not about a luxury or money able to be spent, it is about time alone to celebrate each other.","5. When the Nest Empties","Much like traveling after college or in between jobs, taking a trip after your kids move out marks the end to a major responsibility. While that can be exciting and relieving, its also a big change that can bring about a lot of fear for the future. Purposefully planning a trip around that time can help dampen the sting of the change.","Use a trip after your kids move out to mark a transition in a positive way and create a milestone event, said Mann. Its a nice time to refresh and rejuvenate and be not fearful of change.","Henderson agreed, adding, The very act of going on vacation can be defined by temporarily taking on a new mindset, and this can be noteworthy as one is recovering from a life change. The act of recovering from or processing a change, like your grown children leaving your home, [is] best managed by giving time, space and intention to the transition. Travel can provide this.","6. Following a Breakup","Breakups suck. But, traveling after one can be a healthy step toward beginning life without that significant other. Im all for a breakup vacation, said Mann. Its a fantastic idea. Its nice to have a change of scenery and be reminded of your independence. Her advice? Pick a place you always wanted to go  and your partner didnt. Its all about celebrating that you can do what you want now.","Feature image by Kiattisak Lamchan / EyeEm / Getty Images.","Share this:","News and deals straight to your inbox every day.","SIGN-UP BONUS: 50,000 Miles","TPG'S BONUS VALUATION: $700","CARD HIGHLIGHTS: 10X miles on stays booked and paid for through Hotels.com/Venture + 2x miles on everything else.

Kelly leaves the Cook County jail after posting $100,000 bond on February 25, 2019 in Chicago. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)","Instead of writing and releasing another song re-stating his innocence, R&B star R. Kelly took to CBS This Morning with Gayle King in an explosively emotional interview where he even shed tears over claims that he hurts women and abuses girls. Kelly spoke with King for nearly 80 minutes, and essentially he says that he is being set up and lied on by all the women accusing him of sexual misconduct. He also says he has never kidnapped women or kept a harem. And, he said some parents are to blame for introducing him to their daughters.","This is the first time the singer, recently dropped by his record label and banned from Philadelphia, has publically spoken out against various new allegations.","Im very tired of the lies, said the Grammy winner, who still lives at the Trump Tower in Chicago, which is where the interview took place. Later on he said, \"People have perception. I have truth.\"","Kelly was recently charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, some of the instances stemming from alleged interactions with women who were underage when the alleged crimes occurred. These charges came down two months after the six-part Lifetime docuseries, Surviving R. Kelly, reignited a larger cultural conversation about Kelly, rumors of his interactions with underage girls and his sexual proclivities. King also interviewed the two young women who call themselves Kellys girlfriends and also live with him. The women said that they want to be with Kelly and seemed to be saying they werent being held against their will.","It really is a hot mess, says King, after the interview.","If you missed the interview, here are a few highlights.","The interview also delved into Kelly's own history of being sexually abused as a child and his thoughts on how - or if - he can save his career. Kelly is in court this week to deal with his child support issues and justlast week was bailed out of a Cook County jail by a fan-turned-friend who posted a $100,000 bond on his behalf.

Sure, some of them have been performing better than others in the ratings department lately, but the network obviously wants to keep them all alive long enough so that the upcoming Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover can be a true spectacle.","Still, all good things must come to an end and sure enough, just as we told you the other week, The CW has now cancelledArrow. An exact reason for the cancelation hasnt been provided, but executive producersGreg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Beth Schwartz have released the following statement:","This was a difficult decision to come to, but like every hard decision weve made for the past seven years, it was with the best interests of Arrow in mind.","Were heartened by the fact that Arrow has birthed an entire universe of shows that will continue on for many years to come. Were excited about crafting a conclusion that honors the show, its characters and its legacy and are grateful to all the writers, producers, actors, and  more importantly  the incredible crew that has sustained us and the show for over seven years.","MORE FROM THE WEB","Aside from the fact that we already told you this was coming, its not terribly surprising to hear that its now official. After all,Arrows been around for a while and it was just a matter of time really before star Stephen Amell had to move on with his career.","Not only that, butOliver Queens already leading the pool regarding which major character will meet their maker in Crisis. And if he does indeed end up dying, its unlikely many viewers would stick around for an Arrow-less Arrow.","Still, none of that makes this news any easier to swallow. Its been a long, thrilling and always interesting journey for the show, and The CWs Arrowverse is definitely going to be a drastically different place onceArrowtakes its final bow in season 8  which will consist of only 10 episodes.","MORE NEWS FROM THE WEB","TRENDING","You May Like","New World War Z Gameplay Footage Shows Off The Games Depth","The Walking Dead Fans Are Furious Another Gay Characters Been Killed Off","Watch Avengers: Endgame Stars On The Guardians Of The Galaxy Ride","Dave Bautista To Star In Zack Snyders Army Of The Dead","Angelina Jolies Role In The Eternals Has Been Revealed","Linda Hamilton Says The Last Three Terminator Films Were Forgettable","Apex Legends Has Permanently Banned Cheaters And Theyre Not Happy","Prince Harry Would Like To Ban Fortnite In The United Kingdom","Idris Elba Will Play An Original Character In The Suicide Squad, Not Deadshot","Robert Downey Jr. Kicks Off Avengers: Endgame Press Tour With Awesome Video","X-Men Star James Marsden Open To Returning As Cyclops In The MCU","Rian Johnson Doesnt Mind If J.J.

Likewise, I have bought many books from long-defunct booksellers and even defunct publishers, but I still own those books.","When I was a bookseller, nothing I could do would result in your losing the book that I sold you. If I regretted selling you a book, I didn't get to break into your house and steal it, even if I left you a cash refund for the price you paid.","People sometimes treat me like my decision not to sell my books through Amazon's Audible is irrational (Audible will not let writers or publisher opt to sell their books without DRM), but if you think Amazon is immune to this kind of shenanigans, you are sadly mistaken. My books matter a lot to me. I just paid $8,000 to have a container full of books shipped from a storage locker in the UK to our home in LA so I can be closer to them. The idea that the books I buy can be relegated to some kind of fucking software license is the most grotesque and awful thing I can imagine: if the publishing industry deliberately set out to destroy any sense of intrinsic, civilization-supporting value in literary works, they could not have done a better job.","Several years ago, Microsoft was looking at ebooks as a key content category for the company.

The term, coined by Carol Glover in her book Men, Women and Chainsaws (1992), refers to a young woman, usually virginal, who is the last survivor of a violent psychopath and acts as the investigating consciousness of the film. She shrieked her way through the 1970s and 1980s in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street; Scream (1996), a slasher movie which mocked the worn tropes of the genre, more or less finished her off. So horror has shifted its emphasis onto another female figure: the mother.","Horror flicks, for all their sensationalist tendencies, have long interrogated expectations of motherhood. Pregnancy is shown not as a blessed state but as a dangerous, gory trauma. In Rosemarys Baby (1968), gestation is a violation of sorts, a sickness that eats away at the body and a womans agency. In The Fly (1986), a science-fiction body horror, Ronnie (Geena Davis) has a nightmare about giving birth to a maggot; she seeks an abortion but is abducted. In Alien (1979) the surrealism of having another living being growing inside you is experienced by Kane (John Hurt). When the foreign creature bursts bloodily from his body, it kills him. (In later films Ripley, the sole survivor of the first doomed mission, has similarly nightmarish experiences of pregnancy and parenthood.)","Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.","Childbirth is frightening, and the resulting offspring often even more so. The demonic, terrifyingly uncanny children of The Exorcist (1973) and The Omen (1976) exploit maternal fears of finding a child alien and unlikable, and test the concept of unconditional love. Meanwhile the assumption that women ought to become sweet, caring homemakers has been undermined by casting them as villains. Norman Batess domineering mother is the inspiration for his crimes in Psycho (1960); Sissy Spaceks Carrie (1976) is tormented by her fanatical parent. In Friday the 13th (1980) Jasons mother is the murderous slasher.","In recent years film-makers have returned to these ideas and put several mothers at the centre of stories. A Halloween sequel (2018) showed Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis)the original final girlas an adult, twice-divorced and estranged from her daughter. The Babadook (2014), mother! (2017), Hereditary (2018), A Quiet Place (2018), Bird Box (2018), The Hole in the Ground (2019, pictured) and Us (2019) all featured female protagonists grappling with family issues. Some of these characters are isolated, either through divorce or widowhood. Many are fighting their own demons as well as the villains that wish them harm.","The characters are often ambivalent about their responsibilities and the expectations placed on them. In The Babadook (2014) Amelia (Essie Davis) is a widow whose grief makes caring for her troublesome son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) all the more difficult. The monster of the title comes from a magic pop-up book, but its true identity is a projection of Amelias desperation and anger. In Hereditary, Toni Collettes Annie is a literal homemaker, an artist who specialises in making miniature dollhouses. She had a loveless relationship with her late mother, and plainly resents her own son and daughter. Both films include scenes in which the mother says the unsayable: they wish their children were dead, or had not been born. The sentiment has monstrous consequences.","Other films have cast women as formidable heroes. Evelyn (Emily Blunt), the survivalist mother in A Quiet Place, helps to protect her family against monsters that hunt using sound. She gives birth noiselessly and without help, and takes charge when her husband dies. In Bird Box, Malorie (Sandra Bullock) guides two children, blindfolded, through a post-apocalyptic landscape (some otherworldly force makes people see their worst fears, driving them to commit suicide). The womens maternal instincts are helped by the fact that they are steely and quick-witted.","Horror is most unsettling when it invites audiences to imagine danger in safe places, particularly the home, and so mothers make ideal protagonists. At the same time, these figures allow film-makers to undermine assumptions that women are vulnerable (especially when pregnant), weak and fearful, as well as the idea that motherhood is always a rewarding experience. This makes for complex and nuanced characters. The final girl has grown up into the final mother.","Prospero","by J.B.","Not quiet on the western frontKhalifa Haftar, Libyas strongest warlord, makes a push for Tripoli","Corporate crisesScandals suggest standards have slipped in corporate America","From the archive: The World Banks new leaderWhy Malpass should get the job","!!!!!!!Is Billie Eilish really changing pop stardom?","Join them.

His strength came almost exclusively from white voters, not from the growing Hispanic population in the state.","None of this is to take away from his accomplishment. He did better than every Democrat running statewide in Texas in the 2018 midterms. It seems unlikely that many Democrats would have fared as well as he did, and you could argue it bodes well for his chances in a presidential race. But on balance his success was a reflection of deeper trends.","Mr. ORourkes close result wasnt because of an exceptional turnout that will be hard for other Democrats to repeat in 2020. Republican voters, defined as those who have participated in a recent Republican primary, turned out at a higher rate than Democratic ones. Neither the Hispanic nor youth voter share of the electorate was higher than it was in 2016, when President Trump won the state by nine points.","On the contrary, Democrats in 2020 can be expected to enjoy a more favorable turnout because presidential races tend to draw in more young and Hispanic voters. Mr. ORourke might have won Texas last November if turnout had been at the level of a contested presidential race, based on an Upshot analysis of Times/Siena poll responses, actual results and voter file data from L2, a nonpartisan voter file vendor.","The data yields an estimate of how every registered voter in Texas would have voted, based on a long list of geographic and demographic factors that predicted vote choice in the Times/Siena polling. Importantly, turnout in 2018 is among those factors, which allows us to fully untangle how much of Mr. ORourkes strength was because of strong turnout among his supporters.","The data indicates that two opposing turnout trends influenced the results. The electorate was older, whiter and more Republican than the state as a whole  or than the 2016 electorate. But an ORourke supporter was generally likelier to vote than a demographically and politically similar supporter of Mr. Cruz. This was the pattern nationwide, so it is not obvious that this can be attributed to Mr. ORourke specifically; it could have been the favorable Democratic environment more generally.","Either way, the extra turnout boost probably cut Mr. Cruzs margin of victory by two points.","Mr. ORourke might have won with a turnout of around 10 million voters. (The actual turnout was around 8.4 million.) Without the extra edge of a Democratic wave year, it might have taken 11 million votes, a number that is not out of the question in 2020 if Texas is contested as a battleground state.","So how did Mr. ORourke fare so well? He did it through old-fashioned persuasion, by winning voters who had voted for Republicans and for minor-party candidates.","The results themselves make it clear that he won a lot of voters who supported Republicans in other races. He ran three points ahead of the overall Democratic state vote for the U.S. House in 2018 (adjusted for uncontested races), and ahead of every down-ballot Democrat running statewide.","Mr. ORourkes personal appeal was probably a factor, and theres no guarantee a different Democrat can replicate it. His strong favorability rating (plus-10 in the exit polls, 52 percent to 42 percent) is consistent with that possibility, though he might have also had the benefit of a relatively unpopular incumbent in Mr. Cruz. Only 50 percent of voters had a favorable impression of Mr. Cruz in the exit polls (48 percent had an unfavorable one).","But Mr. ORourkes personal appeal is not the whole story. After all, many Democrats running for the U.S. House or other statewide offices posted noteworthy performances.","The tide lifting all Democratic boats in Texas was an anti-Trump rebellion.","Over all, President Trumps approval rating was at 49 percent in the exit poll and 50 percent in the large AP/Fox Votecast poll. This is consistent with a variety of other survey data, including a recent Quinnipiac poll that put the presidents approval rating at minus-3 among registered voters in the state, 47-50. Gallup, measuring the much more diverse pool of Texan adults, put the presidents approval rating at just 41 percent in 2018.","It is notable that Mr. ORourke, with 48.3 percent of the vote, fell a bit short of the disapproval number of the president. That could reflect that he was facing a well-known incumbent, which offers on average a meaningful benefit to the officeholder (despite Mr. Cruzs relative unpopularity). It could also reflect the states G.O.P. tradition; some number of Republicans may disapprove of Trump but not be ready to vote for a Democrat.","No matter how you explain it, the presidents disapproval rating in Texas would seem to imply that theres at least some additional upside for Democrats there, beyond what Mr. ORourke pulled off. And the presidents far lower approval rating among all adults (as opposed to among registered voters) hints at another opportunity for Democrats: mobilizing unregistered voters. In both cases, Hispanic voters could represent the upside for Democrats.","Mr. ORourkes strong showing had essentially nothing to do with the initial vision of a Blue Texas powered by mobilizing the states growing Hispanic population. The Texas electorate was only two points more Hispanic in 2018 than it was in 2012, but President Obama lost the state by 16 points in 2012, compared with Mr. ORourkes 2.6-point loss.","At the same time, Mr. ORourke fared worse than Mr. Obama or Hillary Clinton in many of the states heavily Hispanic areas, particularly in more conservative South Texas. This could reflect Mr. Cruzs relative strength among Hispanic voters compared with a typical Republican.","Instead, Mr. ORourkes improvement came almost exclusively from white voters, and particularly college-educated white voters. Whites probably gave him around 33 percent of their votes, up from a mere 22 percent for Mr. Obama in 2012.","Theres clearly additional upside for Democrats if they could pair their recent gains among white voters with improvement among Hispanic voters (through some combination of persuasion, higher turnout among registrants and newly registered voters).","Can Democrats really turn out Hispanic voters in huge numbers in Texas? There are real barriers, and you wouldnt expect Hispanic Democrats to turn out in particularly high numbers given their low turnout elsewhere in the country. It is far-fetched to suggest Hispanic mobilization will fundamentally transform the electorate and turn Texas into a blueish state anytime soon.","But a more modest increase in turnout or support among Hispanic voters is fairly likely if Texas sees the campaign dollars and attention that come with a contested state in a presidential year. When Mr. Obama contested Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado in 2008, the turnout there increased by an average of 13 percent to 23 percent over 2004 levels, which included a mix of higher turnout among registrants and thousands of newly registered voters. Given the extraordinary turnout in the 2018 midterm election nationwide, it is plausible that turnout will be up substantially in Texas regardless of whether the state is a battleground.","Is Texas a true battleground state? Mr. ORourke and House Democrats fared much worse in Texas than in clear battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. They also fared worse than in the next tier of Sun Belt battlegrounds, like Florida, Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina. And Texas is substantially more expensive to compete in than any of those states, save Florida.","But if you squint at the midterm results, it is not obvious that Texas will be so far to the right of those Sun Belt battlegrounds. The presidents approval rating in the two election surveys was basically the same in Texas as in Florida, Georgia and Arizona (there were no surveys in North Carolina, where there was no statewide contest). Democrats in Texas, including Mr. ORourke, fared worse in the major statewide contests, but it was also the only state where the Democrats all faced incumbents in such contests.","It is also the state where the Democrats have the most obvious upside in terms of the mobilization of additional voters; the pace of demographic shifts; and the trend toward Democrats in the Trump era.","Put it together, and Texas is on the cusp of being a true (if Republican-tilting) battleground state. It might not be immediately and vigorously contested, as Arizona or North Carolina will most likely be, given the greater expense of campaigning in Texas and the fact that it starts out to the right of those states. But if Democrats chose to contest it seriously in 2020, there wouldnt be anything crazy about that.","Nate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot.

These documents apparently provide a timeline and at least a partial explanation for how Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner obtained their security clearances.","Officially, however, the White House has not turned over key documents in regards to the issuance of these security clearances, and this has led House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings to suggest that a subpoena may be necessary.","InEpisode 9 of KrassenCast, House Oversight Committee Congressman Ro Khanna talked about this issue and many others. Episode 9 of KrassenCastis now available oniTunes,Youtube. andGoogle Play.","When Khanna was asked if he feels that a subpoena would be necessary to convince the White House to comply, Khanna said, I do think a subpoena is likely to be necessary.","When further questioned if he believes the White House would cooperate with a subpoena and what might happen if they decide not too, Khanna answered:","Then it goes to court and its up to the courts to decide whether the president should be required to give these documents. I see no argument for why they shouldnt. Congress should have the right to review the process by which security clearances are given. Here you have a case where the presidents own chief of staff, the presidents on White House counsel and expert career officers or experts in foreign policy all voiced concerns that Jared Kushner shouldnt be given a security clearance, yet he was given a clearance and it puts at risk our national security interests. One can be a supporter of the president and still think that his son-in-law shouldnt have been given top secret clearance, and be concerned that that information may get into the wrong hands.","The entire interview with Khanna is now available oniTunes,Youtube. andGoogle Play, as well as in the video below:","Khanna told KrassenCast that he is concerned about some of the meetings that Kushner has had with MBS and Saudi Arabia.","I cant speculate what information he has given [to Saudi Arabia and others]. Public reports suggest that he has shared information about Saudi dissidents, that he has excluded our embassy from attending some of those meetings and MBS and Saudi Arabia were responsible for the murder of Khashoggi. [MBS] has been leading a systematic bombing campaign against women and children in Yemen, one of the worst humanitarian disasters. So I am concerned about that relationship in particular and Jared Kushner being able to support MBS in his current capacity.","There are a lot of questions surrounding the Trump administrations dealings with various Middle Eastern countries, and many of them appear to have relationships of varying levels with Kushner and his family business. A subpoena may be the only way to thoroughly investigate these matters.","You can subscribe to theKrassenCastpodcast oniTunes,Youtube. andGoogle Play."],"targetCaptions":[]}

This unprecedented level of worldwide interest in someone born seventh in line to the throne will, of course, only increase when the child arrives. And while he or she will be largely oblivious to their position for the first few years, teaching them how to manage the spotlight in the internet age will be just one of the things Harry and Meghan have to factor into their parenting.","Born into the worlds most famous royal family to parents who are two of its current stars, this childs life is not set up to be ordinary. However, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do want to give their son or daughter the chance to experience life outside the royal bubble. This is all the more important because their descendants are not destined for a future filled with royal duties and will instead be expected to carve out their own careers. In the same way that Prince Williams cousins are not full-time working royals, any children Harry has will fall too far down the pecking order to have their lives mapped out with a royal role.","Advertisement","This relative freedom is likely to excite Harry and Meghan who I expect will want their child to be exposed to lots of different opportunities so they can choose for themselves where they want to focus their attention. Harry was sporty as a child before thriving in the army and has championed sport and the military in his charitable work. Former actress Meghan found her love of acting growing up and took part in school plays before deciding to study theatre and international relations at university. Telling staff at Bristol Old Vic Theatre in February she thought creative arts and theatre were equally as important as sport in schools, it seems clear that Meghan will encourage any creative streak her child has.","The duchess also developed a strong interest in gender equality from an early age, successfully campaigning age 11 to change a sexist TV commercial. Palace aides have dismissed claims she will bring her child up gender fluid, but Meghan has made it clear that she wants to pass on her belief in equality amongst the sexes. During a panel discussion on International Womens Day, she said about a documentary she watched: One of the things they said during pregnancy was I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism. I loved that. So boy or girl or whatever it is, we hope that that's the case with our little bump.\"","Read next","Charles, William and Harry attend the premiere of Attenboroughs Our Planet","A royal night out","By\n                        \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Having started their married life in what is often described as the goldfish bowl of west Londons Kensington Palace, the Sussexs hope to be in Windsor by the time their child is born. With Frogmore Cottage undergoing large-scale structural renovations at the taxpayers expense (the couple will pay for their own fixtures and fittings) it is expected that they will make the property their home for several years. The idyllic, rural spot is just 25 miles from their new offices at Buckingham Palace but offers a completely different lifestyle to the intensity of the capital. With the 5,000-acre Windsor Great Park on their doorstep the family can enjoy the outdoors while still being a stones throw from Windsors many shops and cafes. However, if they want to be certain of avoiding attention from the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the picturesque town every year, they may choose to spend their down time behind closed doors. Close friends George and Amal Clooney, who have toddler twins, have a house 30 minutes drive from Frogmore Cottage in Sonning, and longtime confidante Elton John and his husband David Furnish have a house on the edge of the Great Park. The Queen and Prince Philip spend many weekends and every Easter at Windsor Castle. Cousins George, Charlotte and baby Louis will be natural playmates although the move away from Kensington Palace means that the cousins wont grow up constantly popping round to say hello.","Like William and Kate, Meghan and Harry want to play pivotal roles in their childrens lives rather than leave this to nannies. Meghans mum Doria, to whom she is very close and Harry has described as amazing, is expected to visit often and play a key role, although she will continue to live in Los Angeles. However, the couple will almost certainly get professional help, especially once they both resume royal duties. As well as potential nannies they may also choose to follow the Cambridges decision to send their child to a local nursery and will eventually have the pick of Windsors top schools.","Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie grew up in Windsor and both went to Upton House school, which takes girls and boys into the nursery from age two, followed by Coworth Park then St Georges School. Harrys old primary Ludgrove, which he attended from age eight, is a 30-minute drive away. His secondary school, Eton, is even closer at just a 20-minute walk from Windsor Castle. However, just as William and Kate have not chosen Williams old primary school for George, Harry and Meghan may also opt for somewhere completely different.","Even the future king is just called George by his teachers and classmates, and baby Sussex is sure to follow suit and be treated like everyone else in the classroom. What his or her title will be outside that is still to be determined. King George V limited titles within the royal family in 1917 meaning that the option of an HRH Prince or Princess would only be on the table if The Queen steps in and issues a Letters Patent. If Harry and Meghan dont want this, as the eldest son of a duke, a boy would inherit one of his fathers subsidiary titles and be called Earl of Dumbarton. A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor and any subsequent sons would be Lord (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.","Advertisement","Such things will be largely irrelevant when it comes to what sort of life this child will lead. It goes without saying that he or she will almost certainly never want for anything material. However, Harry and Megan - who was once a jobbing actress working to make ends meet - will be keen to make sure that their child is not spoiled or entitled.","It is pretty much impossible that this baby can ever inherit the throne - for example Prince Michael of Kent was born seventh in line and now at age 76 will become 48th after the birth of baby Sussex. That said, the sons of Princess Diana grew up side by side in the full - and equal - glare of the spotlight, meaning that the interest in Harry gives this family a unique place in the hearts and minds of many around the world. The fascination with the Sussexs could lessen significantly as time passes, with the focus shifting towards George, Charlotte and Louis as the future of the monarchy. Yet, with celebrity culture existing around the world like never before and the internet and social media making falling out of the spotlight almost impossible, it could be the case that the Sussex familys prominence never really fades.","The path that this babys life will take is not pre-determined. The huge interest in the road ahead for him or her most certainly is.","Share this article","Recommended","Royals","Royal baby name predictions for Baby Sussex","From traditional monikers like Victoria and James, to wildcard choices like Amelia and Spencer","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Rebecca Cope","Duchess of Sussex","The Duchess of Sussex is pregnant","There's a new royal baby on the way","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Tatler","Royals","What life was really like on-board Royal Yacht Britannia","Water fights, Carry-On-style sketches, afternoon tea and more","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Annabelle Spranklen","Features","Royal Ascots most exclusive enclosure relaxes its dress code","Race-goers will be able to follow whichever dress code they like","By\n                                    \t\t\t\t            Rebecca Cope"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Spacesuits","Nasa saw immediate outrage on Twitter when they announced the all-female spacewalk would be cancelled over a medium-sized spacesuit.","The agency clarified that astronaut Anne McClain had belatedly realised the medium size fitted her better than the large she had been using, and so, for safety reasons, she was pulled from the walk.","There are two medium-sized suits on the International Space Station, but only one had been properly configured for a spacewalk, and getting the spare up to standard would have taken hours.","Ms Criado Perez says it's still telling that the sizes available were medium, large, and extra-large only.","Notably, Nasa had to nix their small sized suits in the 1990s due to budget cuts, NPR reported. That meant one-third of the women at the time were unable to fit into any spacesuits.","2. Military equipment","In 2016, the US military began to recruit women for combat roles in previously male-only units in the Army, Marine Corps and Navy SEALs - but much of the armour was still designed for men.","The Army added eight smaller sizes to accommodate women that year, but other gear like shoes and helmets were not fully addressed.","Democratic Congresswoman Niki Tsongas at the time called out the military's unresponsiveness to the needs of female service members, citing the \"alarming\" disadvantages for women, including being unable to properly fire a weapon, Military.com reported.","Several women told Buzzfeed News this year that during their service, they had been forced to adapt body armour to fit them, even if that meant removing protective side panels or putting pieces of foam under straps to reposition gear and ensure their organs were protected.","Last year, the Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Joseph Dunford said they would work on speeding up the process of getting armour fitted for women, but the rollout of new gear remains incomplete.","\"Women went through Iraq and Afghanistan - up to 2018 - in equipment designed for men,\" says Alex Elias, a scholar focusing on women in the military.","But even before these relatively new roles opened up, women in the military were forced to deal with dangerously improper attire. During World War Two, Ms Elias says, women were never expected to be in non-office roles, so the military failed to prepare uniforms for other jobs, like mechanics.","3. Car crash dummies","The US government did not adequately test the impact of a crash on a belt-restrained female dummy until 2012. Dummies for decades had been based on the average, 50th percentile male body.","According to a 2011 University of Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics study, that meant female drivers involved in crashes had a 47% greater chance of serious injury than their male counterparts, and a 71% higher chance of a moderate injury.","Ms Criado Perez notes that even now, this female dummy is often just a scaled down version of a male dummy, which does not provide accurate information about how a crash impacts a woman.","It's a similar story in the European Union.","\"In the EU, out of the five regulatory tests that there are, only one specifies that you must use that [female] dummy and it's only in the passenger seat.\"","She says it's clear the industry is aware they must address the issue of women - but \"they haven't done it in any sensible way that accounts for the fact that women are 50% of the population\".","4. Smartphones","From apps to the actual size, there are a number of design features that have made some women say smartphones have been designed with only men in mind.","Women's hands are, on average, around an inch smaller than men's - which can make the industry's ever-increasing screen sizes problematic to use.","Texting one-handed on a 4.7-inch (12cm) or bigger iPhone can be difficult to impossible for many women (and small-handed men).","Ms Criado Perez also pointed out that the health app and Siri were also unintentionally biased against women.","In 2016, Apple fixed a glitch that had Siri sending abortion seekers to adoption centres instead - five years after the issue was raised.","\"The comprehensive health app on the iPhone that didn't have a period tracker; the way Siri could find a Viagra supplier but not an abortion provider - that's what happens when you don't include women in the decision making process,\" Ms Criado Perez says.","\"It's not a conspiracy. I don't think for a moment the designers of Apple wanted to screw women over - I think they didn't know.\"","5. Sports attire","When US basketball superstar Stephen Curry designed a new line of shoes for kids last year, only boys sizes were offered.","A nine-year-old girl named Riley eventually wrote Mr Curry a letter asking why that was the case.","\"I know you support girl athletes because you have two daughters,\" she added. \"I hope you can work with Under Armor to change this because girls want to rock the Curry 5's too.\"","Mr Curry thanked her and explained that the smaller sizes had all been labelled as \"boys\" on the website.","As of March 2019, boys still have more apparel options in the Under Armor Curry line, but most of the shoes are available for both genders.","6. Science gear","Biologist Jessica Mounts, executive director of the Kansas Alliance for Wetlands and Streams, told the BBC's Chris Bell that most of the equipment she has used was designed for men.","\"The problems caused aren't simply an annoyance - they all go back to personal safety,\" she says. \"Clothing that is too loose gets caught in moving equipment. Boots that are too big mean tripping and falling.\"","\"The alternatives that are 'designed for women' are frequently more expensive, have smaller pockets, are still ill-fitting.\"","Read her full story here.","7. Office space","These design flaws aren't just about something worn or handled - even environments can be biased towards men's preferences.","The formula for standard US office temperatures was developed in the 1960s, based on the metabolic rate of an average 40-year-old man weighing 154 pounds (70kg).","A 2015 study published in the journal Nature found that a female metabolic rate can be up to 35% lower than the male rate used in those calculations - which amounts to, on average, a five degree temperature preference difference.","Last year, Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon brought the issue to headlines ahead of a primary debate with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, when her team called his frigid temperature demands sexist.","Historian Shirley Wajda says: \"For all the corporate talk about teamwork, it's hard to feel part of a team when you are placed in an inhospitable physical environment.\"","She added that popular mesh office chairs exacerbate chilly conditions, while other seating fads like barstool-height chairs can be difficult for women in dresses or skirts to sit in comfortably.","Ms Wajda says when it comes to \"gender-biased design and equipment, historians haven't paid as much attention\", and trends towards standardisation for efficiency's sake lead to \"a 'one size fits all' sort of world\".","For Ms Criado Perez, since publishing her book, it's been gratifying to see an increased awareness of these issues - and, she adds, even the initial backlash about the Nasa spacesuits would never have happened a decade ago.","\"But it makes me so angry to think of all these women, living their lives, thinking there's something wrong with them - that they're too small or don't fit or whatever it is.\"","\"It's just that we haven't built anything for women.\"","Related Topics","Share this story        Aboutsharing","More on this story","Top Stories","The chancellor believes an agreement can be reached with Labour despite no talks planned this weekend.","Features","The NFL star abandoned on London's streets","Unforgettable TV - Our Planet, Attenboroughs Netflix debut","The treasure hunt that gripped a nation","How did the Kardashians make their millions?","The women divided by Brexit","Israel election: Who are the key candidates?","The 'womanspreading' placard that caused fury in Pakistan","Secrets of Race Across the World","How Algeria's army sacrificed a president to keep power","Elsewhere on the BBC","Legendary live gigs","Five life-changing concerts from the music world","Daily news briefing direct to your inbox","Sign up for our newsletter","BBC News Navigation","BBC News Services","Explore the BBC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

It sounds like generic health advice, but theyre tips supposedly tailored to my DNA profile.","The suggestions come from 23andme, one of the companies offering to point you toward the optimal eating and exercise habits for your genetics. As with most dieting schemes, the idea is appealing because it implies theres an elusive reason why you cant get in shape  in this case, your genes.","But Isaac Kohane, a biomedical researcher at Harvard, said research in the field is still limited and that theres little evidence any small effects from genetic variations can be translated into meaningful dietary advice.","By and large, these are not giving a lot of value to the people who are purchasing them, he said, adding that other factors play a far bigger role on health, such as how much we eat.","Still, its tempting to think your DNA holds clues to your ideal diet. To see what my genes might reveal, I tried two services, 23andMe and DNAFit.","23andMe","If you pay $99 for a 23andMe ancestry report, you can spend $125 more for its health reports based on the same saliva sample.","Among the extras you get are several wellness reports, including one that predicts your genetic weight and offers other dietary insights. These findings are based on comparisons to data from other 23andMe customers.","After adjusting the default setting from European to East Asian descent, my report said Im predisposed to weigh about average. For a 40-year-old, 5-foot-6 woman, the company defined average as 138 pounds. 23andMe notes that most its customers are of European descent, and that its data for other ethnicities is more limited.","The report then lists 10 habits associated with healthy weights for your DNA profile. For me, that included limiting red meat, avoiding fast food and exercising at least twice a week. Given how formulaic that sounded, I wondered how much results vary for others.","It turns out everyone gets the same 10 habits, since those are the ones 23andMe decided to survey people about. But the order in which theyre listed varies to indicate the magnitude of their supposed effect for you. Alisa Lehman, senior product scientist for 23andMe, said the top two habits for most people are limiting red meat and avoiding fast food, as they were for me.","Like many other nutrition studies, the findings do not establish cause-and-effect relationships, but are links the company makes between customers genes and the survey results.","Other wellness reports said Im more likely to be lactose intolerant (check), to flush when drinking alcohol (check) and to consume less caffeine (check). They were more interesting because of their specificity, but didnt reveal anything surprising. Another report said my weight isnt likely to be affected by my intake of saturated fat, which is commonly found in meat.","The only surprise was learning I have a genetic variant common in elite power athletes. When I followed the link, however, I saw about half of customers have the same variant.","DNAFit","For $99.99, you get a saliva collection to produce reports on a variety of fitness and dietary traits. If you already have your DNA file from 23andMe, you can upload it to get instant results for $79.","DNAFit says its reports are based on the broader universe of scientific research about genes and diet.","Given the general fear of carbs among many dieters, I started with the carbohydrate sensitivity report. It started with an overview explaining the difference between complex carbs like brown rice and refined carbs like sugar that are digested more quickly.","After scrolling down, the report said I have a very low sensitivity, meaning Im less susceptible than others to sugar highs and diabetes. Despite this carb tolerance, it suggested I limit refined carbs to 10 per cent of daily calories. Again, this sounded like fairly generic advice and made me wonder how much the recommendations vary for others.","Andrew Steele, head of product at DNAFit, said that depending on peoples sensitivity, the recommended limit for refined carbs ranges from 6 to 10 per cent of total calories. For someone who eats 2,500 calories a day, thats a range from 150 calories to 250 calories.","While that may not seem like a big difference, DNAFit notes cutting back from 10 to 6 per cent would mean a 40 per cent reduction. Still, the relatively tight range reinforces the idea that dietary advice would be largely consistent regardless of your genes.","Another report said my sensitivity to saturated fat is low, and suggested limiting it to 10 per cent of calories. DNAFit said the range for that recommendation is also 6 to 10 per cent.","Other reports were more nutrient specific. One said I have a raised need for omega-3, the cholesterol-lowering fatty acid. Another said I have a raised risk for DNA damage from chargrilled meats and should limit them. (This advice was provided over an image of candle-lit steak.)","On the fitness side, the reports said Im more prone to endurance activities than high intensity activities. I dont know if Ill take this into consideration if I start exercising. Others have questioned the accuracy of the fitness reports, which rated one Olympic runners aerobic potential as medium.","DNAFit and 23andMe say knowing your genetic predisposition can motivate you to stick with diet or exercise routines. You may also have specific reasons for wanting to try the services, particularly 23andMe, which most get for the ancestry tests and provides many other reports. But for me, the findings from both felt too broad to influence my habits.","One small note: DNAFit is based in the United Kingdom, so if you decide to try it, you may notice a small currency exchange fee on your credit card statement.","","Follow Candice Choi at http://www.twitter.com/candicechoi","","The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

British Summer Time (BST) officially starts at 1am on Sunday 31 March, when the clocks go forward an hour to 2am.","With Brexit on the horizon, it remains to be seen whether changes to daylight savings time (DST) plans in continental Europe will have any effect on the British clocks in the future. This week MEPs voted to approve plans for European Union member states to abolish clock changes if they want.","DST has been mandatory in the EU since 2001, but the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has been championing the change, saying: Clock-changing must stop. Member states should themselves decide whether their citizens live in summer or winter time.","Countries are expected to choose to either remain permanently on summer or winter time, although Portugal and Greece are among those which have previously indicated they would rather retain the present system.","Post-Brexit this could become a thorny issue on the island of Ireland, with Dublin and Belfast going an hour out of synch with each other if the UK does not also abandon the concept of DST. The argument over a hard border on the island could make way for one about a time-zone border.","Spain is grappling with an even bigger time conundrum. In the 1940s, Gen Francisco Franco moved the whole country permanently an hour forward to Central European Time, keeping it in synch with Hitlers Germany, rather than with neighbouring Portugal and the countries with which it shares longitude. It means that in the westernmost parts of Spain, sunrise can sometimes be as late as 8:56am. In 2016, the Spanish government began to look into solving the problem by permanently shifting the country back to Greenwich Mean Time.","It is more than a 100 years since the changing the clocks was first established in the UK under the Summer Time Act 1916. Despite the results of the EU survey suggesting that 82% of British respondents wanted to abolish DST, there does not seem to be any great political will to do so.

Here's Why.","targetDescription":"The activists who confronted Chelsea Clinton at the vigil for victims of the Christchurch massacre explain their actions.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Opinion: We Confronted Chelsea Clinton At The Christchurch Vigil. Here's Why.","The activists who confronted Chelsea Clinton at the vigil for victims of the Christchurch massacre explain their actions.","By\n      \n        Leen Dweik and \n      \n        Rose Asaf","Posted on March 16, 2019, at 7:17 p.m. ET","Yesterday we posted a video of Leen confronting Chelsea Clinton at a vigil for the victims of the white supremacist New Zealand mosque massacre. Today, we woke up to over 100,000 people talking about it on Twitter. Needless to say, this is not what we expected.","We went to the vigil for one reason: to grieve the loss of innocent lives that were stolen from this world by vile hatred. We wanted to join our friends and colleagues in a time of heartbreak and agony, to remember the 49 Muslims who were murdered for being Muslim. As a Jewish American-Israeli and a Palestinian Muslim, we understand far too well the consequences of anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry, and white supremacy. And as activists who are unafraid to speak the truth, we know we have a duty to call out any bigotry wherever it exists.","We did a double take when we first noticed Chelsea Clinton was at the vigil. Just weeks before this tragedy, we bore witness to a bigoted, anti-Muslim mob coming after Rep. Ilhan Omar for speaking the truth about the massive influence of the Israel lobby in this country. As people in unwavering solidarity with Palestinians in their struggle for freedom and human rights, we were profoundly disappointed when Chelsea Clinton used her platform to fan those flames. We believe that Ilhan Omar did nothing wrong except challenge the status quo, but the way many people chose to criticize Omar made her vulnerable to anti-Muslim hatred and death threats.","We were shocked when Clinton arrived at the vigil, given that she had not yet apologized to Rep. Omar for the public vilification against her. We thought it was inappropriate for her to show up to a vigil for a community she had so recently stoked hatred against. We were not alone in feeling uncomfortable  many students were dismayed to see her there.","So when we saw Chelsea, we saw an opportunity to have her ear and confront her on her false charge of anti-Semitism against our only Black, Muslim, Somali, and refugee member of Congress. We took our chance to speak truth to power. Chelsea hurt our fight against white supremacy when she stood by the petty weaponizers of antisemitism, showing no regard for Rep. Omar and the hatred being directed at her.","We know that our only safety is through solidarity. The fight against anti-Muslim bigotry is the fight against anti-Semitism is the fight against racism is the fight against white supremacy. When someone attacks one of us, they attack all of us. We know that our struggles are intertwined, and for any of us to be safe, all of us must be safe.","Rose (left) and Leen (right) at a previous protest.","Many have said it was unfair to connect Chelseas words to the massacre in Christchurch. To them, we say that anti-Muslim bigotry must be addressed wherever it exists. This is not about left and right. This is about people who do and do not have power, and how those with power use it. A global environment of hatred and vilification against Muslims created this killer. Spurred on by professional bigots, anti-Muslim hate now permeates our culture and politics, and everyone, as a matter of urgency, should consider the role they play in enabling it. That includes Chelsea Clinton.","The reality is that many people arent doing enough to fight anti-Muslim bigotry. We need people to understand that you cannot be racist against Palestinians, and vilify people who promote their cause, while also being in solidarity with Muslims. You cannot contribute to the anti-Muslim, anti-Black, and misogynistic abuse of Rep. Omar while also being in solidarity with Muslims.","To Chelsea Clinton: We hope that our intentions in confronting you are now clear. We believe that you still owe an apology: not only to Rep. Omar, but also to Palestinians for using your platform to defame their cause. As an Israeli national and a Palestinian, we want you to know that it is dangerous to label valid criticisms of Israel and its lobby as anti-Semitic. We know that this is a tactic to silence us and deny us our free speech.","Unfortunately, people have cynically seized on this confrontation to divert attention from the conversation we need to be having about anti-Muslim bigotry and white supremacy. People have subjected us to a relentless bullying campaign, death threats, and threats of sexual violence. In their haste to defend Chelsea Clinton, people continue to vilify a Muslim woman for speaking her truth.","But we are not deterred. This is a turning point, and white supremacy and anti-Muslim bigotry must be defeated. It begins with keeping our own accountable. Our hearts are with the Muslim community and the victims families. We will continue to fight for justice for everyone.","Rose Asaf is a senior at New York University where she studies comparative politics and American studies. She is an Israeli American Jewish woman, and she cofounded the Jewish Voice for Peace chapter at NYU.","Leen Dweik is a senior at New York University studying international relations and Middle Eastern and Islamic studies.

Indeed, a survey by Northwestern Mutual found that money was the dominant source of stress for 44% of Americans, followed by the 25% who said personal relationships, and just 18% blaming work. And data from the American Psychological Association also shows that money is the No. 1 stressor for Americans: Regardless of the economic climate, money and finances have remained the top stressor since our survey began in 2007, the results revealed.","Money stress is widespread -- and its seeping into our work lives. Financial firm John Hancocks Financial Stress Survey released Tuesday found that 69% of workers were stressed over their finances, with fully 72% admitting to worrying about their personal finances at work, and one in three doing that more than once a week.","Its no wonder, as Americans are drowning in financial troubles. Credit card debt hit a record high this year at more than $1 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. Student loan debt has jumped 150% over the span of just a decade. And not only are we drowning in debt; were also not saving. About 1 in 4 Americans dont even have a single dollar saved for an emergency.","All of this takes a big toll on us: A survey by the American Institute of CPAs found that more than half of Americans with debt say that its negatively impacted their lives. And a survey released by online lending marketplace LendingClub reveals that Americans who report poor financial health also tend to have poor physical health. Indeed, they are significantly less likely to practice healthy physical habits (59% do not get routine check-ups and 60% do not get regular exercise) and they are more likely to skip preventative health measures due to cost (38%). Bad wealth begets bad health, the survey concluded.","Whats more, these money issues are causing more than just some feelings of dread and skipped doctors office visits. Here are some of the many ways financial stress may impact your health:","Depression and anxiety.People with greater financial stress have more symptoms of depression and anxiety than those who arent financially stressed, according to a 2013 study published in the journal Anxiety, Coping and Stress. And John Hancocks data reveals that financial stress is triggering physical and psychological symptoms like anxiety and sleeplessness for roughly 60% of workers.","Migraines. A study released in 2017 found that for many people, financial stress is related to getting more migraines. Indeed, people with a certain genetic variation of the so-called CLOCK gene -- it helps control things like body temperature and levels of the stress hormone cortisol; about  of the population has this variation -- are more likely to get migraines in times of financial stress.","Ulcers and digestive issues. An Associated Press poll showed that people who are under high financial stress are way more likely to complain of ulcers and digestive problems (27% of them said they had these issues) than those who have low financial stress (8%).","High blood pressure and heart attacks. High levels of debt may also lead to higher blood pressure, according to a 2013 study of 8400 young adults published in the journal Social Science Medicine. Treating hypertension can cost you $700 or more per year, data shows Annual expenditures for those treated for hypertension averaged $733 per adult in 2010. Whats more, people with high financial stress are more likely to report theyve had a heart attack or an arrhythmia (6%) than those with low financial stress (3%), according to AP data.","Disrupted sleep. Well over half of both women (68%) and men (56%) say they lose sleep at least occasionally because theyre worried about money, according to a survey of 1,000 adults released in 2016 by CreditCards.com, a credit-card comparison website. And that can be very costly: Americans spend more than $40 billion on sleep aids.","This story was originally published in September and has been updated.","See the world with cash-color glasses.

I was hit four times.","It hurt so bad.","Now, these teachers and the states largest teachers union want to stop this from happening in other Hoosier schools. The Indiana State Teachers Association is lobbying lawmakers to add language prohibiting teachers from being shot with any sort of ammunition to a school safety bill working its way through the Statehouse.","What we're looking for is just a simple statement in this bill that would prohibit the shooting of some type of projectile at staff in an active-shooter drill, said Gail Zeheralis, director of government relations for the ISTA during testimony in support of House Bill 1004 before lawmakers Wednesday.","Sheriff has stopped using pellet gun in teacher training","The White County sheriff said Thursday that his department has conducted similar training before but, after receiving a complaint, will no longer use theair-powered device, called an airsoft gun, with teachers.","Active shooter training went wrong. Here's how experts say it should go.","Teachers at Meadowlawn Elementary School were supposed to be receiving what is called ALICE training, an\"options-based\"approach that encourages students and teachers to be proactive in their response to an active shooter and teaches tactics that include rushing a shooter in some situations.","Thousands of schools across the country, including many in Indiana,are using ALICE already. Shooting teachers with plastic pellets is not typically part of the training.","'This is not normal practice'","Ive worked with teachers in other districts who have gone through ALICE,and this did not happen, said Barbara Deardorff, an ISTA official who represents 16 school districts, including the Twin Lakes district and Meadowlawn Elementary. This is not the normal practice.","Deardorff saidthe Meadowlawn incident, which she said she learned aboutseveral weeks ago, marked the first time shed heard of such practices being used on teachers in active-shooter training.","White County Sheriff Bill Brooks, whose department led the training in question,said it has conductedactive-shooter training with schools for several years and has previously used theairsoft gun.","The plastic pellets they used are 4.6 mm in diameter slightly larger thana standard BB.","\"It's a soft, round projectile,\" he said. \"The key here is 'soft.'\"","'It's a shooting exercise'","Brooks became sheriff in January and said he couldn't say if or how many times teachers had been shot with it previously. He was present for part of the January training, but not the portion in which the airsoft gun was used.","\"They all knew they could be,\" Brooks said. \"It's a shooting exercise.\"","Brooks said all the teachers involved signed up to participate. He said the department was told several weeks after the training that one teacher was upset by it. They've since stopped using the airsoft gun with teachers, he said.","\"We were made aware that one teacher was upset,\" he said. \"And we ended it.\"","IndyStar has brought you the news for 116 years. Help us keep doing it.","Both of the Meadowlawn teachers who spoke to IndyStar said they were not warned by the officers beforehand that anyone would be shot. They said they were given paintball masks, which law enforcement said were a precaution fordifferent scenarios throughout the training.","The teachers said the airsoft gunwas used in several other exercises as well. Neither of them were hit with pellets during those scenarios, but several other teachers were.","All teachers in the first scenariowere shot, though, where they were lined up facing a wall and shot across their backs.","Teachers whispered warnings to colleagues","One of the teachers said she was waiting in the library with her colleaguesas the first small group of teachers was led into a classroom for one session.","The firsts group went in and we heard them scream and yell, she said. We thought, What is going on?","The group came back out and whispered a warning to the next group the officers had told them not to tell their colleagues what had happened but she still wasnt expecting what came next.","It was like a quick spew of those pellets, she said. Most of us got hit several times in our backs.","She said she had welts and one spot where the pellet broke her skin. It was scabbed over for several weeks.","Both teachers IndyStar spoke to said all Meadowlawn teachers and some cafeteria staff went through the training in January. There were two sessions, with kindergarten, first- and second-grade teachers and cafeteria workers getting trained in themorning and third- through fifth-grade teachers in the afternoon.","Training injuries on the rise","A picture posted to the schools official Facebook page on Jan. 4 shows teachers sitting around wooden tables with a law enforcement officer standing before them.","Its captioned: Thankful for the partnership between our school and local law enforcement. Today our staff received training from The White County sheriffs department. Safety is priority at ML!","Twin Lakes Superintendent Michael Galvin released a statement Thursday, saying that the district has met with the sheriff's department and the local chapter of the teachers union about the training.","\"The Twin Lakes School Corporation is committed to providing a safe environment for its students and employees,\" Galvin said.","Juli Topp, vice president of member representation for Twin Lakes Classroom Teachers Organization, said she met with the Meadowlawn teachers last week and heard the same story from more than a dozen different teachers.","They voluntarily signed up for this training, however they had no idea they were going to be shot, she said.","Ken Trump, a school safety expert in Ohio who works with schools nationwide, said he had not heard of another incident in which teachers were shot with plastic pellets but that hes heard many stories of teachers getting injured during active-shooter training.","Sadly, it doesnt surprise me, he said. With some of these options-based trainings, weve seen (training) thats just really over the top.","Trump said hes heard of a growing number of workers compensation claims and even some litigation stemming from teacherinjuries during these types of training programs. An Iowa school insurance company reportedly paid out more than $250,000 in claims related to active-shooter training injuries over a two-year period.","Oftentimes, these programs are taught in a train the trainer model. One or two law enforcement officers will receive the training through an organization and then go back and train others in their department. It can leave room for interpretation, Trumpsaid.","One teacher said the officers told the Meadowlawnstaff that police had to go through this same training.","But we are not police officers, she said.","The twoteachers who spoke with IndyStar said they wanted to do the training. Even after getting shot with plastic pellets that left welts and bruises and drew blood, they finished the rest of the training.","We didnt want to quit the training because it seemed important, said one teacher. It really was more than it needed to be.","She said the other training exercises were useful, including one in which an officer pretendingto be an active shooter shot the airsoft gunwhile teachers hid under desks and were given tennis balls to throw at him until he stopped shooting.","One of the provisions included in House Bill 1004 is a requirement that all schools conduct an active-shooter drill at least once a year. However, it does not mandate any specific type of training program. The drill requirement was among 18 school safety recommendations made last year by a committee pulled together by Gov. Eric Holcomb in the wake of the massacre at a Parkland, Florida, high school and last spring's shooting at Noblesville Middle School.","The bill will be up for amendments in the Senates education committee next week, and Meadowlawn teachers are hoping language will be added to keep other teachers going through what they experienced.","Sheriff Brooks said that's unnecessary, though.","\"We dontneed legislation in White County,\" he said. \"Were just not going to do it.\"","The bills sponsor, Rep. Wendy McNamara, seemed amenable Wednesday to an addition of some sort. The Evansville Republican is a high school principal in Evansville Vanderburgh Schools. Because the bill has already passed the House, though, McNamara will have to work with the Senate committee toget an amendment passed.","I dont believe something like that should take place in an active-shooter drill, she said.","Call IndyStar education reporter Arika Herron at 317-201-5620 or email her at Arika.Herron@indystar.com.

Weary from a bruising Senate campaign and unsure about his future, the former Texas congressman left his home in January for a road trip through the American Southwest, brooding about falling into and out of a funk while irritated donors and activists calls went unreturned.","By early February, he had begun to slip in presidential polls.","Story Continued Below","But ORourke, who announced his candidacy for president on Thursday, would soon regain his footing, seizing a stroke of uncommonly good timing to reintroduce himself to Americans as a serious contender. First a government shutdown re-focused public attention on President Donald Trumps proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall  a major issue to Democratic voters and a signature concern of ORourkes. Then Trump flew to El Paso to rally support for the wall, all but daring ORourke to confront him in his home town.","The result  a protest rally that drew thousands of supporters  confirmed to ORourke the durability of his appeal to Democrats beyond the 2018 Senate campaign. It offered the border-state politician a rationale for a campaign focused heavily on immigration. And it marked a turning point in ORourkes deliberations about a run for president.","Privately, ORourkes advisers were struck by the tenor of the crowd at his rally. The chants and placards were less about opposing Trump than encouraging to ORourke to run for president. And the candidate himself began to overcome concerns about the demands a campaign would place on his family. He had begun to gain back weight he had lost during the Senate campaign, and according to several people close to ORourke, he received encouragement from family members who had previously expressed reservations.","In the weeks following the February rally, ORourke spoke personally with prospective staffers about the shape of a 2020 run in early primary states, and he dusted off his massive email list, sending out updates on his events and surveys typical of a presidential campaign.","Then, in recent days, ORourke began plotting a trip to Iowa to coincide with his announcement. While ORourke began calling high-profile figures in the first-in-the-nation caucus state ahead of his visit today, he dispatched intermediaries to seek meetings with labor and Latino leaders, two sources familiar with ORourkes conversations told POLITICO. By late Wednesday, the campaign had alerted top ORourke supporters to prepare to text or email their own donor networks links to contribute to the campaign once he announced.","On Thursday, ORourke urged supporters to join him in the greatest campaign this country has ever seen.","We are truly now more than ever the last great hope of earth, he said in a video posted on social media. At this moment of maximum peril, and maximum potential, lets show ourselves and those who will succeed us in this great country just who we are and what we can do.","ORourke, a former El Paso councilman and three-term congressman is, at 46, less experienced than many of his Democratic competitors. And there is little historical precedent for him to draw on. While Abraham Lincoln ran for president successfully after two failed Senate campaigns, the last person to go from the House to the presidency was James Garfield in 1880.","2020 Elections","Beto announces bid for president","By DAVID SIDERS","During ORourkes Senate race last year, Trump called him a total lightweight, and a former campaign assistant, Joey Torres, said ORourke himself once questioned the potential of a failed Senate candidate in a presidential campaign. While ORourke was running for his House seat in 2012  and following the Republican presidential primary in the media that year  Torres recalled to POLITICO ORourke telling him of then-Sen. Rick Santorum, You know, you can never become president coming off of a loss.","Still, ORourkes fundraising capacity and public polling suggests he will enter the 2020 primary in the top tier of contenders. Some Democratic donors, staffers and activists had refused to commit to other candidates while they awaited word of ORourkes plans. Draft Beto campaigns sprang up in early nominating states, and advisers to rival Democrats privately fretted about the potent list of small-dollar donors that ORourke used to raise $80 million in his Senate campaign.","This is why I think Beto is a major player, because of his fundraising ability, because of his message, and he is immediately a top-tier candidate in my view, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who ran for president in 2008, said recently. The stars really are aligned for him.","Yet ORourke will enter the race at an organizational disadvantage to his more established rivals. His candidacy will immediately test the limits of a relatively inexperienced politician who has only run for office as an insurgent, not as a favorite, and who, despite his broad appeal, has at times befuddled the Democratic Party establishment and angered the most progressive edge of the Democratic Partys base.","In his Senate run against Ted Cruz, a Republican universally reviled by Democrats, ORourke enjoyed near-unfaltering support from within his own party. But as he began mulling a presidential run, ORourke came in for intensifying criticism from within his partys ranks  with progressives vilifying him for his membership in the centrist New Democrat Coalition and for his acceptance of campaign money from oil industry employees, among other issues.","ORourkes advisers have dismissed such lines of criticism, after a Senate campaign in which ORourke was chiefly faulted for being too progressive in a heavily Republican state. Nevertheless, as other Democratic presidential contenders court the partys leftward-tilting base, ORourke has suggested that he will likely attempt to position himself as a less ideological  and more unifying  figure.","Asked in December if he is a progressive Democrat, ORourke told reporters, I dont know. Im just, as you may have seen and heard over the course of the campaign, Im not big on labels. I dont get all fired up about party or classifying or defining people based on a label or a group. Im for everyone.","ORourke said during the Senate race last year that he would not run for president in 2020. But he changed his mind soon after the election. Even though ORourke and his wife, Amy, said they worried about the toll a presidential campaign would take on their three young children, few people close to ORourke believed he would not run.","Now ORourke will be tested in his appeal to progressive voters who did not have other high-profile Democrats to choose from in his run against Cruz. And he will have to persuade many skeptical, older Democrats that he has the necessary experience to be president.","Im a little frightened by all these new, young Congress people and their audacity, said George Appleby, a Des Moines-based attorney who has long been active in presidential campaigns in Iowa. It seems to me we live in a really dangerous world.","In the run-up to his announcement, ORourke has at times struck a lofty, traditionally presidential tone. In January, he said his decision would hinge on whether he felt he had satisfied my commitment to this country and our democracy, and in February, he cast himself as a healing figure in a divided time.","This is our moment of truth, the most divided point that this country has reached since 1860, a time so highly polarized and partisan that we have a hard time listening to, talking to one another if we are of a different political persuasion, ORourke said at an event in El Paso. On issues ranging from climate change to immigration and foreign wars, he said, Think about any challenge, even the most existential ones. The only way we will be able to meet them is if this divided country comes together, if our democracy once again works.","Yet ORourke has not always projected such confidence in himself. When he left Texas in January for an unusual, unaccompanied road trip through the Southwest, ORourke wrote that he had been stuck lately  in and out of a funk.","He wrote, Maybe if I get moving, on the road, meet people, learn about whats going on where they live, have some adventure, go where I dont know and Im not known, itll clear my head, reset, Ill think new thoughts, break out of the loops Ive been stuck in.","2020 elections","Beto O'Rourke plans extended Iowa trip","By DAVID SIDERS","The trip  and ORourkes writing  drew some mocking online. But it was praised by former operatives for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. On Twitter, Axelrod wrote that ORourkes missive from the road may not be the conventional route to a presidential candidacy but, in its humility and connection, it also reflects why so many want him to run.","Tactically, ORourke is expected to embark on a campaign reminiscent, in some ways, of Sanders run in 2016. In private conversations with Democratic strategists in recent weeks, ORourkes advisers had begun outlining an operation that would expand on the distributed organizing model used by Sanders and replicated by ORourke in his Senate campaign, with the campaign training low-level staffers and volunteers to run their own door-knocking, text and email operations.","In Iowa, ORourke is being assisted by Norm Sterzenbach, a former executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party. Paul Tewes, who ran Obamas 2008 operation in the state, is also helping ORourke. Yet it is unclear if he will hire a pollster, a traditional campaign practice that ORourke  to the chagrin of some fellow Democrats  eschewed in 2018.","I havent really gotten to thinking through those kinds of issues, he told reporters in El Paso following an event in February. I think any campaign I run  I would want to run in the same way that Ive run every race  just as grassroots as possible, powered by people, directly connected to the people that I want to serve and represent.","This article tagged under:","Missing out on the latest scoops?

Gaston? Eh, maybe.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["COLLECTIONS","SECTIONS","TOPICS","TOPICS","DAILY FLOSS","COLLECTIONS","DAILY FLOSS","ABOUT","The 14 Disney theme parks located around the world attract so many attendees each year that the company recently decided to increase admission for peak times by 20 percent to help decrease crowd congestion. Anaheims Disneyland is such a popular tourist attraction that some days the park is actually at capacity.","What keeps visitors packed in like sardines? The promise of a suspended realityone that treats the various Disney characters as though they had just stepped out of a movie. Theres a laundry list of employee policies to help sustain that illusion, and Travel + Leisure recently uncovered one of the most interesting ones: Actors dressed as Disney characters are never allowed to say I dont know to guests.","The motivation is understandable: Disney never wants people to feel as though they need to wander around looking for information. If they pose a question to, say, a Disney Princess, the actor is expected to communicate with other employees or areas of the park in order to find the answer. If Elsa doesn't know where the nearest restroom is, she's tasked with finding out before your kid's bladder gives up.","If a guest is looking for general directions, theres also protocol for how to point. Performers are not allowed to use their index finger by itself. Instead, they use it in conjunction with their middle finger. In addition to index finger-pointing being considered rude in some cultures, legend has it that the gesture was partly inspired by Walt Disney himself, who once roamed the park grounds pointing at structures with two fingers that pinched a cigarette.","[h/t Travel + Leisure]","SpongeBob Squarepants is a cartoon for children. But the way some fans talk about it on social media, youd assume its a gritty drama about drug addiction, war, and nuclear annihilation. People have grafted a ton of dark themes onto SpongeBob, Patrick, and all their equally cheery underwater pals, suggesting their sunny dispositions are masking some serious trauma. Here are 10 of the bleakest, weirdest, and most hilarious fan theories about the showsome of which have made their way back to SpongeBob himself.","1. Bikini Bottom is the result of nuclear testing.","One of the most popular SpongeBob SquarePantstheories claims that Bikini Bottom is located directly underneath Bikini Atoll, the Marshall Islands atoll where the U.S. government conducted 23 nuclear tests during the Cold War. That means SpongeBob and his friends are aquatic mutations whose bodies and minds have been warped by the nuclear waste above. The Bikini Atoll theory would also explain why everyone in this modern underwater community sends letters, and dresses like a dad from the 1950s.","2. The main characters represent the seven deadly sins.","Sloth, pride, greed, gluttony, lust, envy, and wrath. Theyre the seven deadly sins, but theyre alsoaccording to some Nickelodeon viewersSpongeBob's seven maincharacters. Patrick spends most of his day snoring under a rock, so hes sloth. Mr. Krabss obsession with money makes him a clear candidate for greed, while cranky Squidward is a neat stand-in for wrath. Planktons sole mission in life is to steal the Krabby Patty recipe and with it, Mr. Krabss success for himselfwhich is pretty envious. That leaves gluttony for Gary, pride for Sandy, and lust for overly-friendly SpongeBob.","3. Squidward is SpongeBobs guardian.","While SpongeBob loves spending time with his neighbor, Squidward tolerates him at best. So why doesnt Squidward moveor quit his job working alongside SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab? According to a Reddit theory, SpongeBobs secretly rich parents hired Squidward to watch over SpongeBob, whom they suspect has ADHD. Though they worried about how their son would fare on his own, they wanted him to have an independent life, so they bought SpongeBob a nice househow else could he afford it on a fry cooks salary?and gave Squidward a loan to help him move next door. Squidward has served as a sort of guardian ever since, and SpongeBobs parents purchased a deceptively modest home for themselves nearby so they could spend more money on travel.","4. Its all about global warming.","You probably assume SpongeBob SquarePants, who lives in a pineapple under the sea, is a sea sponge, right? Wrong! For this metaphor to work, he needs to be a kitchen sponge, representing human waste and pollution. Mr. Krabs, as SpongeBobs employer, stands in for the large corporations that cause pollution, while Patrick, as SpongeBobs best friend, is western civilization, i.e. lazy and the main cause of the world's pollution. Squidward is the liberalism that calls for action against climate change, but because no one shares his interests, hes constantly ignored.","5. Krabby Patties are made from crabs.","What is it that makes Krabby Patties so delicious? It all comes down to a secret ingredient that only Mr. Krabs knows, and there might be a sinister reason why hes keeping it under lock and key. Many Redditors believe Mr. Krabs is a cannibal who makes his burgers with crab meat. He has killed and served up all his crab friends for the business, which is why hes seemingly the only crab in town, and some even speculate that the long-absent Mrs. Krabs was a victim of his scheme.","6. The patties are actually vegan.","But what if Mr. Krabs only serves burgers that taste like crab? One counterargument claims that he engineered a convincing imitation crab meat, and that is the true key to his success. Crustacean customers get all the great seafood taste, without the soul-sucking guilt of eating their best friends. Its why they prefer the Krusty Krab to the rival Chum Bucket, which serves actual chumnon-imitation fish parts.","7. The main characters are each addicted to a different drug.","SpongeBobs quirks can be explained by personality, or hallucinogens. This theory posits that at least five SpongeBob SquarePants characters are addicted to a specific drug. SpongeBob takes shrooms, since he has a hyperactive imagination and the capacity for both joy (i.e. a good trip) and panic (i.e. a bad trip). Patrick prefers weed, as evidenced by his slow speech, carefree attitude, and frequent bouts of the munchies. Squidwards moodiness and poor job performance could be attributed to heroin abuse, while Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puffs ill tempers and paranoia might be signs of a cocaine problem.","8. SpongeBob is a veteran suffering from PTSD.","Some fans have picked up on strange similarities between SpongeBob SquarePants and military veterans. He wears the same thing every day, wakes up at the same time (with a horn!), and addresses his boss with vaguely militaristic terms, like yes, sir! If SpongeBob is a veteran struggling with PTSD, he might have some weird verbal ticsand seek stability in a full-time fry cook gig and quiet neighborhood.","9. The show is a metaphor for pre-WWII Germany.","Like so many discussions on the internet, this theory begins with Hitler. The logic goes that Squidwarda failed artist and kind of a jerk, with a squid superiority complexrepresents Adolf Hitler. He wants to get rid of SpongeBob, who embodies the Jewish people. Patrick stands for German ignorance; he lives alongside SpongeBob and Squidward but seems totally oblivious to their toxic dynamic. Sandy Cheeks is America, trying to free the Jews (SpongeBob) from Hitlers (Squidwards) tyranny. Finally, Mr. Krabs represents the rest of Europe, which looks down on Hitler and Germany for its role in WWI.","10. SpongeBob and Squidwards homes are remnants of a tiki bar.","What do you usually see at a tiki bar? Paper lanterns, flaming cocktails, pineapples, coconuts, stone tiki heads, and a bunch of faux flowers. And what do SpongeBob and Squidwards houses look like? A pineapple and a stone tiki head. This Reddit theory argues that a sunken ship with a tiki bar onboard brought these items to the bottom of the sea, and SpongeBob and Squidward decided to make them into homes.","Have you ever noticed that in the Harry Potter films, Voldemort holds his wand very loosely, almost to the point that it doesn't look like hes actually holding it at all? Youre not the only one. Its one of those elements that has become a sort of inside joke among Potterheads. Now Ralph Fiennes, the Oscar-nominated actor who portrayed Voldemort, has finally revealed the truth about his character's wand and the unique way in which he holds it.","Fiennes talked to GQ about his time playing the famous villain, and admitted that he had never read or watched any of the previous Harry Potter books or movies before taking on the role. But after his sister and her children told him it was a pretty big deal to be cast in Goblet of Fire (2005), he signed on.","After reading up on his snake-like character, Fiennes wanted his portrayal of Voldemort to be just as J.K. Rowling described him: gentle, with slithering movements, and silence concealing all the power that lies beneath. The actor wanted Voldemorts wand to be an extension of that description.","\"With Stuart Craig, who's the production designer, and his team, we discussed what the wand would be,\" Fiennes explained. \"It has a hook on it, so I can hold my hand, and then the end can hook around this finger. Like I almost have the hand open ... you'd think it would fall off the hand. But I just enjoyed that it could be light in the hand.\"","If youre rewatching the Harry Potter movies and notice that Voldemorts wand looks almost out of his grasp, now you know your eyes arent deceiving youit was actually a behind-the-scenes trick.","[h/t: GQ]","SECTIONS","How to Check the Status of Your Passport Application","How to Scan Documents Using Your iPhone's Notes App","That Email You Didnt Reply To?

Now that Trump won't acknowledge basic things like climate change, it's time other countries had a say","I was nine years old when I first seriously pondered the result of a US presidential election. It was 2000 and my father suggested we bet on who would win the 2000 vote  George W Bush or Al Gore. In the kitchen of our apartment in the Paris suburbs, I bet a piece of gum that it would be Gore. Two months later, the Supreme Court decided otherwise, and I didnt realise until many years later how close I had come to being right.","Perhaps thats when it originated: the idea that maybe other countries shouldnt just be left wringing their hands every four years and waiting to see who US citizens had chosen to appoint as (to speak like a White House staffer on Scandal) the leader of the Free World.","And perhaps that seed of an idea continued to gestate in 2004, when we waited to find out whether John Kerry would deprive George W Bush of a second term; then in 2008, when T-shirts bearing Barack Obamas red and blue Hope poster started cropping up on the streets of the French capital; and again in 2012, when we learned the names of his Republican challengers.","Well tell you whats true. You can form your own view.","From\n    15p\n    0.18\n    $0.18\n    USD 0.27\n    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.","Then, of course, came November 2016, by which time I had moved from my native France to the US. I came home from work at approximately four the morning after the election and spent an hour or two on the phone with my mother (it was mid-morning in Paris) talking about Donald Trumps ascent to power and what it meant for America as well as for the world.","One election after the next, we have seen how much the results of the US presidential vote impact not just the 50 states, but the rest of the planet too. And if the future of foreign countries is shaped to a significant extent by what goes on on US Election Day, shouldnt they get a say in who gets to lead the most powerful nation in the world for the next four years?","In other words: shouldnt foreign countries have a right to vote in the US presidential election?","I know, I know. The idea sounds so absurd, so outrageous that its hard to know where to begin your rebuttal. I have floated it around, timidly, in bars and at various dinner parties over the years, and let me tell you  its hard to get people to agree with me. And I get it: its never been done. I will probably never be done. But last week, a terrorist killed 50 people in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The alleged gunman, who had referred to himself as a white nationalist, viewed Donald Trump as a symbol of renewed white identity. So, yes, I think its high time to acknowledge the fact that what happens in the US has immense, tangible consequences on the rest of the world, and I am tired of crossing my fingers hoping that American voters will do the right thing.","I remember the Iraq war debate, and how George W Bush expressed his disappointment at my country and others for deciding not to align with US forces  while insisting that he was not mad we had decided to opt out of the invasion. I remember our collective bewilderment at the term freedom fries, and I remember lacking clarity on some of the details, on account of being 11 years old at the time. But the feeling that the US, more than any other nation, shapes our collective future has only grown clearer and stronger since.","Perhaps it helps to imagine America as the pot in which tomorrows ideas are brewed, for better or worse. Perhaps it helps, too, to look at the more tangible signs of how US politics contribute to shaping all of our lives. The most convincing example may be global warming, and Donald Trumps overt skepticism when it comes to climate change. In January this year, the president of the worlds most powerful nation infamously tweeted: \"In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can't last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming [sic]? Please come back fast, we need you!\"","It goes without saying that whatever the US does or does not do to limit the effects of global warming impacts every single being, human or otherwise, on this planet.","Then comes the economy: in June last year, we were warned that tensions between the US and its main trading partners could precipitate global trade turmoil similar in scale to the 2008 financial crisis. Whoever gets to sit in the Oval Office, then, plays a major role in shaping the state of our wallets as well as the state of the planet. Is it really that outrageous that people around the world might want to have a say on who runs the show?","I am, of course, aware that the US is extremely unlikely to go along with my idea. This isnt a country thats particularly known for avidly seeking external input. And of course, theres the idea that the right to vote is intrinsically tied to residence, and that those who dont live in a given country arent qualified to make a call on what goes in said country.","Except things are more complicated, and more nuanced than that. Take, for example, the idea that living in a country is a condition to having the right to vote there. Permanent residents such as myself, also known as green card holders (also known as people who arent US citizens but live and work in the US full-time) pay the same income tax as US citizens, but dont get to vote. Naturally, US citizens (like citizens of many other countries) still get to vote for their president even if they permanently move to a different country. All this to say: there is an established disequilibrium between who gets to vote in the US presidential election and who arguably has the most skin in the game.","Shape\n    Created with Sketch.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\nWho could be running against Trump in 2020?","1/23 Bernie Sanders","2/23  Hillary Clinton","3/23 Joe Biden","4/23 Kamala Harris","5/23 Elizabeth Warren","6/23 Beto ORourke","7/23 Wayne Messam","8/23 Kirsten Gillibrand","9/23 Cory Booker","10/23 John Delaney","11/23 Julian Castro","12/23 Tulsi Gabbard","13/23 Pete Buttigieg","14/23 Andrew Yang","15/23 Marianne Williamson","16/23 John Kerry","17/23 Michael Bloomberg","18/23 Howard Schultz","19/23 Eric Holder","20/23 Eric Swalwell","21/23 Terry McAuliffe","22/23 Sherrod Brown","23/23 Mitch Landrieu","1/23 Bernie Sanders","2/23  Hillary Clinton","3/23 Joe Biden","4/23 Kamala Harris","5/23 Elizabeth Warren","6/23 Beto ORourke","7/23 Wayne Messam","8/23 Kirsten Gillibrand","9/23 Cory Booker","10/23 John Delaney","11/23 Julian Castro","12/23 Tulsi Gabbard","13/23 Pete Buttigieg","14/23 Andrew Yang","15/23 Marianne Williamson","16/23 John Kerry","17/23 Michael Bloomberg","18/23 Howard Schultz","19/23 Eric Holder","20/23 Eric Swalwell","21/23 Terry McAuliffe","22/23 Sherrod Brown","23/23 Mitch Landrieu","How would it work, then?

Do we restrict the vote to member states of NATO and/or historical allies? This seems slightly more realistic  as realistic as it gets in this purely hypothetical scenario  but also somewhat unfair to those whose voices would be left out.","I have clearly disclosed my status as a French citizen, so I know the question will be raised: how would I react if someone proposed to let other countries vote in the French presidential election? Well, France is currently about five spots behind the US in the ranking of the worlds most powerful nations, and its GDP is more than seven times lower.

Joining holdovers Star-Lord and Groot were Beta Ray Bill, Cosmic Ghost Rider, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell. The new Guardians came togetherwhen it was revealed that Thanos had found a way to resurrect himself in someone else's body following his death at the hands of Gamora inInfinity Wars.","With the thought of Thanos version 2.0 looming somewhere out in the galaxy, Starfox assembled all of Marvel's cosmic characters together with the idea of killing Gamora, who is the most likely suspect for the Mad Titan to choose as his vessel. When the Black Order attacked the reading of Thanos' will, the villains opened a black hole to kill the heroes while they stole Thanos' corpse.","RELATED:Marvel's Evil Guardians of the Guardians' First Target Isn't Who You Think","Cosmic Ghost Rider, Beta Ray Bill, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell escaped to warn Star-Lord and Groot of what took place, but they weren't the only survivors. Starfox, Guardian of the Shi'ar Empire, Nebula and Wraith teamed up to become the Dark Guardians, with Cosmic Ghost Rider ditching the heroic Guardians to join their ranks. Now, a manhunt is underway for Gamora, who has gone underground following her heel turn inInfinity Wars. Of course, you'd think Star-Lord would be all for warning Gamora before the Dark Guardians learn of her whereabouts, but that isn't the case. Thankfully, there is a character willing to do whatever it takes to help his former teammate, even if it means commandeeringleadership of the Guardians of the Galaxy from Star-Lord.","All HailCaptain Groot","Infinity Warssaw Gamora go on quite a kill spree -- going by the moniker Requiem, Gamora killed Thanos and Star-Lord, two men who were quite close to her. The use of the Time Stone to rewind time is the only reason Star-Lord is still alive, but that hasn't taken away his memory of being betrayed by Gamora.Guardians of the Galaxy #1-2 have shown Peter Quill mentally struggling to get over being killed and brought back to life, which has left him numb to all the chaos currently ongoing in the galaxy.","When Groot and the rest of the Guardians decide to go help Gamora, Star-Lord refuses to get involved, leaving Groot with no choice but to relieve Peter of his command over the Guardians of the Galaxy, thereby becoming the team's new leader.","We also find out Groot has named Beta Ray Bill as his second officer, meaning Groot doesn't believe Star-Lord is even fit enough to be his second-in-command. Groot takes control of the Ryder, leaving Star-Lord no choice but to tag along, whether he likes it or not.","Before the issue concludes, Peter reveals Gamora is on Halfworld in search of Rocket, which could bring another former Guardian back into the series.","RELATED:Thanos' Final Gauntlet May Tear the Marvel Universe Apart","Groot enteredInfinity Wars in his Baby Groot form, but left it transformed with the ability to speakin complete sentences -- though he still refers to himself in the third person. This transition makes his new position as the Guardians' Captain even more entertaining, because we know exactly what he's saying. No more guessing games -- Groot is now in charge.","Tags:\nguardians of the galaxy,\nfeature","Leave A Comment","More in CBR Exclusives","WonderCon LIVE: The Cast of Archer Rockets Us To Archer: 1999","Seriously, Why Is Zac Efron Rumored For So Many Superhero Roles?","The OA Season 2 Gives Us An Even Better House on Haunted Hill","Times That Superheroes Were Way Too Casual About Mindwiping People","The DC Extended Universe Timeline, From Wonder Woman to Shazam!","EXCLUSIVE: First Look at DC's The Flash Year One","Remember When Captain Mar-Vell Had to Drink a Potion to Breathe on Earth?","Teen Titans: Was Jericho Always Gay?

UK-based signatories must also share a valid postcode.","While email addresses are easy enough to set up, doing that in real time at high volume is less straightforward.","Additionally, while it is possible to buy lists of email addresses stolen in various data breaches on the black market, the owner of the list would still need to access those email accounts and retrieve the validation email before being able to sign in the name of somebody else.","The email verification would be likely to deter bots said Lisa Forte, partner at the cyber-security firm Red-Goat.","\"Any significant political decision such as this petition is highly likely to attract bots,\" she told the BBC.","\"This particular petition is now employing email verification before signing, meaning it is much harder and therefore much less likely bots are being employed.\"","'A bit of a pain'","Cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont said that while it was possible that bots were involved, it would be \"a bit of a pain\" to build a sophisticated enough programme to cope with the email addresses.","\"They would have to make a bot that signs up with unique email addresses, then clicks the unique link to sign,\" he said.","The House of Commons declined to comment on its security checks but it did say the Government Digital Service uses \"a number of techniques\" to identify potentially fraudulent signatures and bot activity.","It is not possible to use the same email address more than once to sign the petition.","However, bot activity could still be used to slow down or crash the platform, meaning that people wanting to leave genuine signatures could be prevented from doing so.","This is known as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.","How secure is the petition platform?","\"I'm not sure the system itself is that sophisticated - it fell over as soon as people started voting in large numbers,\" said Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University.","The UK government's petition platform has crashed several times under the weight of traffic in recent days. The petition launched on 20 February, but has now gone viral.","\"Is there some gaming going on? I wouldn't be at all surprised,\" he added.","\"It's a petition, it's not a vote - it's not meant to be as secure as an e-voting system.\"","According to the rules of the site, anyone can submit a petition. If it gets 10,000 signatures it will receive a government response, and if it gets 100,000 it will be debated in parliament. Beyond that, the numbers don't make a difference, he pointed out.","Is it Russia?","Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested that \"Russian collusion\" was behind the unprecedented traffic towards the Brexit petition.","While Russia is notorious for seeking to meddle in the politics of the west, on this occasion there is a question mark over what its intentions would be, added Prof Woodward.","\"All the evidence is that Russia was supporting the Leave campaign,\" he said.","\"So why would they suddenly be supporting Remain?\"","While the petition data (which is currently not updating) reveals that signatures are coming in from all over the world - including small numbers from Russia, China, Iran and one from North Korea where it is unlikely the page can be seen - the UK government said that any British resident or citizen can sign, wherever they are.","The BBC understands that fewer than 4% of signatures are coming from outside the UK at time of writing.","It is however not difficult to disguise or hide a location on the web.","Has it happened before?","In 2016, an earlier petition calling for a second EU Referendum attracted 3.6m signatures, but was hijacked by bots.","In January 2017 a petition calling for the end of \"mass signings by bots\" was rejected by the Petitions Committee on the grounds that it was unclear what was expected of the government.","Related Topics","Share this story        Aboutsharing","More on this story","Top Stories","The chancellor believes an agreement can be reached with Labour despite no talks planned this weekend.","Features","The NFL star abandoned on London's streets","Unforgettable TV - Our Planet, Attenboroughs Netflix debut","The treasure hunt that gripped a nation","How did the Kardashians make their millions?","The women divided by Brexit","Israel election: Who are the key candidates?","The 'womanspreading' placard that caused fury in Pakistan","Secrets of Race Across the World","How Algeria's army sacrificed a president to keep power","Elsewhere on the BBC","Legendary live gigs","Five life-changing concerts from the music world","Daily news briefing direct to your inbox","Sign up for our newsletter","BBC News Navigation","BBC News Services","Explore the BBC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

A 2019 survey found about 28 percent say they don't understand the ins and outs of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which passed in December 2017.","To take a closer look at what's confusing taxpayers, financial website GOBankingRates created a four-question quiz that covers key portions of the law. A whopping 77 percent of the 501 respondents failed, assuming, the site notes, that \"a passing grade means getting more than half the questions right.\"","\"Most Americans are in need of a refresher prior to filing their taxes,\" GOBankingRates concludes. \"These results appear to indicate that many taxpayers are poorly informed.\"","Of the four questions, here is the one that most respondents got wrong:","How many different tax brackets are there for tax filers in 2019?","The answer: 7Percentage of respondents who answered correctly: 10","A full 90 percent of quiz takers failed to answer this one correctly.","Tax reform brought changes to the seven tax brackets, which determine the rate you pay on portions of your income. Congress adjusted the rates and income levels that correspond to them.","NerdWallet: Tax brackets and rates for single filers  click to enlarge","When taxpayers filed returns in 2018, the brackets were 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. The brackets that apply this year are 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent and 37 percent.","\"Being 'in' a tax bracket doesn't mean you pay that federal income tax rate on everything you make,\" though, financial website NerdWallet points out in its 2018 Tax Study.","For example, if you are a single filer with $32,000 in taxable income, you'd be in the 12 percent tax bracket but wouldn't actually pay 12 percent of the full $32,000. Instead, you would pay would 10 percent on the first $9,525 and 12 percent on the rest.","If you're a single filer with $50,000 in taxable income, on the other hand, you'd pay 10 percent on the first $9,525, 12 percent on the chunk of income between $9,526 and $38,700 and 22 percent on the rest.","\"The total bill would be about $6,900,\" NerdWallet says, or \"14 percent of your taxable income, even though you're in the 22 percent bracket.\"","NerdWallet tax bracket example","Keep in mind that these rules apply only to federal income taxes, though, according to NerdWallet: \"Your state might have different brackets, a flat income tax or no income tax at all.\"","If you're confused as to how tax brackets work, you're not alone: Nearly half, or 48 percent, of Americans in NerdWallet's 2019 Tax Study say they don't know what tax bracket they're in.","\"It could just be a sign of the times\" that Americans don't know more about their taxes, says GOBankingRates, but it's still useful to stay informed: Some filers could see lower refunds because of changes to the tax law. And about 30 million could actually owe money to the IRS.","Staying in the dark about taxes could \"set you up for a potentially rude surprise when you file,\" says GOBankingRates, or it might cause you to \"plan around a refund that doesn't materialize.\"","While Americans overall scored low on the quiz, the reseachers explain, older millennials did seem \"more in tune with the changes included in the new bill.\" Respondents aged 25 to 34 had the highest passing rate at 27 percent.

Americans now consume an estimated 280 eggs per person per year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And that's a significant increase compared with a decade ago.","Part of the renewed appeal stems from the dietary advice we got back in 2016. That's when the U.S. Dietary Guidelines dropped a long-standing recommended limit on dietary cholesterol. The move was seen as a green light to eat eggs.","But a new study published in the medical journal JAMA reopens a long-standing debate about the risks tied to consuming too much dietary cholesterol.","\"What we found in this study was that if you consumed two eggs per day, there was a 27 percent increased risk of developing heart disease,\" says researcher Norrina Allen, an associate professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University.","\"It was surprising,\" Allen says.","The researchers behind the JAMA study tracked the health of about 30,000 adults enrolled in long-term studies. On average, participants were followed for about 17 years.","Prior studies have come to competing conclusions. But overall, there has not been strong evidence that limiting consumption of cholesterol-rich foods lowers the amount of artery-clogging LDL cholesterol that ends up in our blood.","Nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conclude that dietary cholesterol and cholesterol in the blood are only weakly related. But Allen says that \"we don't know as much as we'd like to about how the cholesterol you consume in your diet is translated into the blood.\"","The new study is an observational study, so it doesn't prove that cholesterol caused the increased risk of heart disease that the researchers documented. \"These new findings provide one piece of evidence,\" Allen says. But it's possible that other lifestyle or dietary habits may be responsible for the increased risk.","One shortcoming of the study is that participants were asked only one time about their diets. So, this one snapshot may not have accurately captured their eating habits over time. \"We hope that in future studies we can look at how changes in diet over the long term may be impacting this risk for heart disease,\" Allen says. Future studies could also explore how the risks linked to dietary cholesterol may vary from person to person.","Big picture: Many experts say this study is no justification to drop eggs from your diet.","\"So much data have already been published on this topic, which generally show that low-to-moderate egg consumption (no more than one egg per day) is not associated with increased risk of heart attack or stroke,\" Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in an email.","Hu says that when it comes to healthful eating, the best strategy is to focus on a well-rounded diet that includes a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds.","Thomas Sherman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Medicine, agrees. \"I tell my students that eating a protein-rich breakfast is one of the best ways of preventing getting hungry,\" Sherman says. \"So I'd hate for them to come back to me and say, 'Oh, no! We're not supposed to be eating eggs.' \"","Sherman says if you're in the habit of eating a healthy diet, full of lots of plant-based, fiber-rich foods, then \"eggs are a welcome part of the diet.\" Just don't overdo it.","But the findings may reopen the debate about whether to reinstate a recommended limit on dietary cholesterol. A committee of experts was named this year to begin the process of revising the U.S. Dietary Guidelines. And Allen says, \"I do think that guideline committees will have to take the evidence [from this study] into account when they're trying to understand what a healthy  or a moderate  amount of cholesterol would be.\""],"targetCaptions":[]}

Free housing, college tuition, health care and welfare skyrocketed until a fiscal crisis ended the binge. As the city nearly went bankrupt, crime soared and families and businesses fled.","Liberals have been replaced by progressives, but no matter what they call themselves, a new generation of New York pols are ignoring history as they tax and spend at astronomical levels.","This time, there isnt any excuse about good intentions. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo both want to be president, and they are recklessly turning New York into a leftist lab experiment to get national attention for themselves. Their party controls both the City Council and the state Legislature.","The result is a slow-motion disaster, with years of excessive tax and fee hikes making the city and many suburbs prohibitively expensive to govern and unaffordable for residents and employers.","City government spending has soared by 25 percent since 2014, and reports last week that de Blasio squandered $1.8 billion on just two programs, one in education and one on mental health, were shocking but not surprising. Spending on the homeless has doubled, to more than $2 billion annually, even as the homeless population grows.","Cuomo blew through $10 billion on economic development projects that spawned more corruption than jobs. This year, state spending is going up by about 4 percent, even as income tax collections are declining by more than 4 percent because higher-income families are fleeing to low-tax states.","In addition to the tax burden, other progressive policies also make New York unaffordable. A $15 minimum wage and other costs imposed on businesses are driving up everyday prices. And Cuomos pandering to the radical environmental lobby raises the cost of energy and constricts supply.","The governor banned fracking, rejected gas pipelines, reduces fossil fuels and wants to end nuclear power. The bill is now coming due, with natural gas and electric prices  already among the nations highest  set to rise by double digits.","see also","De Blasio cancels embattled, high-cost Renewal school program","Shortages are another result. In a crippling blow to new development, Con Edison imposed a moratorium on new natural gas connections in most of Westchester County, saying it might not be able to meet added demand. It warned a similar moratorium might be necessary in the city.","In another hit to consumers, they learned that prices on suburban trains and bridge and tunnel tolls are going up by about 6 percent, even as inflation is just 2 percent.","But the biggest boondoggle of all is a planned new tax on Manhattan congestion. If approved by the Legislature, it will cost drivers several thousand dollars a year for starts, making it the single biggest tax hike on the working and middle class in memory. Because delivery trucks will get hit with double or triple that amount, prices are sure to rise on everything from beer to baby food.","No longer pretending the tax will relieve Midtown congestion, the mayor and governor say the tax is necessary to close an operating deficit and help fund a new capital plan for the troubled subway system. They also promise to streamline the notoriously wasteful agency, an evergreen vow that nobody takes seriously.","One portion of the congestion tax, covering yellow cabs and ride-sharing companies like Uber, already took effect despite driver protests. One rider told me of three instances where yellow-cab drivers turned off their meters to avoid having to charge the $2.50 congestion tax and expected higher tips instead.","see also","McCray's 'Thrive' initiative on track to spend $1B in 5 years","For a recent Uber ride to Midtown, taxes amounted to 18 percent of my $42 fare, including the congestion fee, sales tax of 8.875 percent and a separate 2.5 percent tax called a black car fund to give drivers workers compensation insurance. The full congestion tax could add $10 or more to the fare.","Reports indicate that the tax-and-spending surge is exacerbating the long, steady exodus of middle-class and upper-income families. Much like their 1970s predecessors, Cuomo and de Blasio insist their policies are the answer when in fact they are the problem.","The governor often makes false claims about the new federal tax law, saying again Friday it is raising taxes on New York families.

Sandberg-directed film has finally lifted, allowing film critics to reveal their full thoughts on the superhero flick. As it stands now, reviews look generally positive across the board, with many critics praising the movie's comedic tone and Zachary Levi's performance of the titular character.","ComicBook.com's Brandon Davis loved the film, calling it the \"best movie based on a DC Comics character since The Dark Knight changed the comic book movie game in 2008.\" Keep scrolling to see the reactions from other critics around the industry!","Shazam! hits theaters April 5th. Are you seeing Shazam! opening weekend? What have you thought about the teasers? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!","-----","Have you subscribed to ComicBook Nation, the official Podcast of ComicBook.com yet?

Make sure to subscribe now and never miss an episode!","\"All things considered, Shazam! shapes up to be the best movie based on a DC Comics character since The Dark Knight changed the comic book movie game in 2008. Christopher Nolan's film probably still holds the torch for best film in the genre given its ability to transcend the comic book movie world and become a psychological thriller, above all else, but Shazam! certainly gives the film a run for its money. It's the sheer levels of fun, heart, and terror Shazam! masterfully balances which make it a lightning bolt of joy.\"","Read the full review here.","\"Shazam! is hardly the first comic-book film to adopt a tone of breezy postmodern irreverence. The Deadpool movies, with their Mad-magazine snake-tongued nihilism, got there a while back, and before them there was Robert Downey Jr.s ironic-quip-spewing Tony Stark, and if you go back to the 1978 Superman, part of that films timeless charm is that it was already too late in the 20th century to play Clark Kents Adonis-in-glasses stumblebum gawkiness entirely straight (and Christopher Reeves performance was pure screwball). Flash Gordon, in 1980, presented its space-jock hero as a delicious beefcake joke (the fact that you could scarcely tell whether Sam J. Jones was an actor or a high-school gym teacher was part of it). And then, of course, there was Batman, the 60s TV series that started it all  a show that had its tongue planted so firmly in its face mask that it practically invented the mainstreaming of camp.\"","Read the full review here.","\"Shazam! is a DCs most joyful and sweet movie since the days of Christopher Reeves Superman, a funny yet earnest coming-of-age story about a boy who learns that, well, with great power comes great responsibility. So obviously, Shazam! doesnt reinvent the superhero movie, but its an undeniably fun time that left me wanting more big-screen adventures with these charming characters.\"","Read the full review here.","\"This may prompt angry emails, but here it goes anyway: Shazam has always been a third-tier superhero, in my opinion. Then again, a year ago I would have said the same thing about Aquaman, and look what happened to him. These days, even the bottom of the barrel can be strip-mined for gold, it seems. Which brings us to DCs new and mostly improved Shazam 2.0. Written by Henry Gayden and directed by Annabelle: Creations David F. Sandberg, Shazam! is a lot jokier and zippier than the spandex tentpoles weve come to expect from DCs often-lugubrious stable of cinematic superheroes. The credit for that almost entirely goes to Zachary Levi (Chuck), who plays the title character with an infectiously nave, gee-whiz charisma that calls to mind Tom Hanks in Big more than anything.\"","Read the full review here.","\"With or without the name, the spirit of the old Captain Marvel adventures is very much at the heart of Shazam!, even amid a lot of just-barely PG-13 violence and a couple of gags about a strip club. Thats part of what makes it such a gleeful alternative both to the grimness of past DC films  a tone the company seems eager to shed  and the cosmos-in-the-balance stakes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Whether played by Angel or Levi, Billy is just a kid. Its fun to watch him take delight in his new powers, and a little frightening to realize how little control he has over them. And where Batsons earliest comics adventures gave him a big city to treat as a playground, Shazam! does the same with Philadelphia. His pleasure at bouncing around the city proves infectious, even though he always seems to be on the verge of accidentally leveling a city block.\"","Read the full email here.","\"These days, superhero movies need a little something extra to make them stand out from the pack. They cant just be a typical, big-budget, flashy action movie. There needs to be a certain level of humor, pathos, or some poignant commentary that takes the film to the next level. In the case of David F. Sandbergs new DC movie Shazam, thats exactly what happens, by hiding a movie about the power and importance of foster families inside a sometimes-silly superhero origin story.\"","Read the full review here.","\"Admittedly, Billy is not the original Shazams ideal candidate. But the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) has recently unleashed the Seven Deadly Sinsmonstrous gargoyles that hearken back to the special effects of films like Ghosterbusters IIand is poised to take over the world. Like Billy, Sivana was once taken away to Shazams lair as a child, but failed the wizards test, as have hundreds since. With no time to keep looking for a more fitting replacement, the bearded sorcerer imbues Billy with his magic before crumbling to dust. Now, all he has to do is say his name, Shazam, and hell be transformed into an adult superhero (Zachary Levi) in an old-fashioned puff of lighting and smoke. The movie knows that this is all eye-rollingly silly; at first, Billy cant even say the word with a straight face.\"","Read the full review here.","of","'Shazam!'

UK-based signatories must also share a valid postcode.","While email addresses are easy enough to set up, doing that in real time at high volume is less straightforward.","Additionally, while it is possible to buy lists of email addresses stolen in various data breaches on the black market, the owner of the list would still need to access those email accounts and retrieve the validation email before being able to sign in the name of somebody else.","The email verification would be likely to deter bots said Lisa Forte, partner at the cyber-security firm Red-Goat.","\"Any significant political decision such as this petition is highly likely to attract bots,\" she told the BBC.","\"This particular petition is now employing email verification before signing, meaning it is much harder and therefore much less likely bots are being employed.\"","'A bit of a pain'","Cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont said that while it was possible that bots were involved, it would be \"a bit of a pain\" to build a sophisticated enough programme to cope with the email addresses.","\"They would have to make a bot that signs up with unique email addresses, then clicks the unique link to sign,\" he said.","The House of Commons declined to comment on its security checks but it did say the Government Digital Service uses \"a number of techniques\" to identify potentially fraudulent signatures and bot activity.","It is not possible to use the same email address more than once to sign the petition.","However, bot activity could still be used to slow down or crash the platform, meaning that people wanting to leave genuine signatures could be prevented from doing so.","This is known as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.","How secure is the petition platform?","\"I'm not sure the system itself is that sophisticated - it fell over as soon as people started voting in large numbers,\" said Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University.","The UK government's petition platform has crashed several times under the weight of traffic in recent days. The petition launched on 20 February, but has now gone viral.","\"Is there some gaming going on? I wouldn't be at all surprised,\" he added.","\"It's a petition, it's not a vote - it's not meant to be as secure as an e-voting system.\"","A lot of people have been asking about numbers. Between 80,000 and 100,000 people have been simultaneously viewing the petition to revoke article 50. Nearly 2,000 signatures are being completed every minute.","End of Twitter post  by @HoCpetitions","According to the rules of the site, anyone can submit a petition. If it gets 10,000 signatures it will receive a government response, and if it gets 100,000 it will be debated in parliament. Beyond that, the numbers don't make a difference, he pointed out.","Is it Russia?","Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested that \"Russian collusion\" was behind the unprecedented traffic towards the Brexit petition.","While Russia is notorious for seeking to meddle in the politics of the west, on this occasion there is a question mark over what its intentions would be, added Prof Woodward.","\"All the evidence is that Russia was supporting the Leave campaign,\" he said.","\"So why would they suddenly be supporting Remain?\"","While the petition data (which is currently not updating) reveals that signatures are coming in from all over the world - including small numbers from Russia, China, Iran and one from North Korea where it is unlikely the page can be seen - the UK government said that any British resident or citizen can sign, wherever they are.","The BBC understands that fewer than 4% of signatures are coming from outside the UK at time of writing.","It is however not difficult to disguise or hide a location on the web.","Has it happened before?","In 2016, an earlier petition calling for a second EU Referendum attracted 3.6m signatures, but was hijacked by bots.","In January 2017 a petition calling for the end of \"mass signings by bots\" was rejected by the Petitions Committee on the grounds that it was unclear what was expected of the government.","Related Topics","Share this story        Aboutsharing","More on this story","Top Stories","The chancellor believes an agreement can be reached with Labour despite no talks planned this weekend.","Features","The NFL star abandoned on London's streets","Unforgettable TV - Our Planet, Attenboroughs Netflix debut","The treasure hunt that gripped a nation","How did the Kardashians make their millions?","The women divided by Brexit","Israel election: Who are the key candidates?","The 'womanspreading' placard that caused fury in Pakistan","Secrets of Race Across the World","How Algeria's army sacrificed a president to keep power","Elsewhere on the BBC","Legendary live gigs","Five life-changing concerts from the music world","Daily news briefing direct to your inbox","Sign up for our newsletter","BBC News Navigation","BBC News Services","Explore the BBC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

With over 14 million identified species, the sheer biodiversity on Earth is outstanding. We depend on this diversity for food and resources, which in return allow us to flourish and thrive. However, this symbiotic relationship doesnt necessarily exist for the rest of the universe.","In The Beginning of Infinity, physicist David Deutsch invites readers to conduct the following thought experiment: imagine the universe was divided into cubes the size of our solar system. What would a typical cube look like?","It would be very different than the one we reside in. In fact, a typical cube would be so dark that if the nearest star were to explode into a supernova, we wouldnt even see a glimmer. A typical cube would be about 2.7 Kelvin cold, enough to freeze almost anything, and it would be about one atom per cube empty, which is emptier than the vacuums we create on Earth.","So in a universe that is cold, dark, and empty, Earth is far from typical; our home is a rare and precious oasis.","This cosmic perspective reminds us how we ought to cherish and protect life on Earth, our Pale Blue Dot. Its also a reminder of the hostile conditions of the rest of the cosmos.","As a space-faring species, we have ambitions to explore and potentially inhabit other parts of the solar system and the galaxy at large. Weve seen many remarkable milestones in space exploration and travel in recent decades. Yet the question many scientists are asking is, how can we become a self-sustaining and resourceful species in a universe that is mostly cold, dark, and hostile to life as we know it?","Growing Food in Space","There are many components to building self-sustaining human habitats in space. We have to consider where we would get raw materials for building future cities, how we could generate efficient energy, and how wed access sources of nourishment. As organizations like SpaceX, Blue Origins, and NASA continue to push the final frontier, access to resources in space is becoming an increasingly relevant discussion. The farther away in the solar system we travel, the more difficult it will be to rely on Earth for resources.","When it comes to food, weve recently seen some exciting progress. Chinas ChangE-4 lander made headlines last month when it successfully sprouted seeds on the far side of the moon. Due to the brutal conditions, the plants died shortly after sprouting. However, this was still a notable milestone.","Our ability to create a self-sustaining ecosystemno matter how smallon the moon could be a huge enabler for future missions. NASAs Mars mission, for example, will leverage the lunar surface as a potential pit stop on the way to Mars. Blue Origins CEO Jeff Bezos is also set on creating permanent settlements on the moon. What we learn from our attempts to grow plants on the moon could also be applied to other colonies, like those on Mars.","This isnt the first time astronauts have grown food in space. In August 2015, astronauts on the International Space Station ate the first vegetables grown in space. The space garden in the ISS, known as Lada Validating Vegetable Production Unit is very similar to a greenhouse, where light and water levels are controlled automatically.","These efforts are coupled with genetically engineering plants and seeds to be better equipped to survive conditions in space. Seeds in space need to withstand ultraviolet and cosmic radiation, low pressure, harsher temperatures, and microgravity; modifying their genetics is one way to allow for this. In fact, from rocket fuel to drug production, genetic engineering can be a resource-liberating mechanism.","NASA has also been exploring 3D printing food in space. Last year, they made it possible for astronauts to 3D print pizzas in space.","Self-Sustaining Spacecrafts","One of humanitys main motivators for space exploration is to not force our species to be confined to living on Earth. In the words of science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, The Earth is simply too small and fragile a basket for the human race to keep all its eggs in. Life on Earth is at the mercy of existential threats, like a supernova, nuclear war, or asteroids. Building settlements in other parts of the solar system and the universe would serve as an insurance policy for humanity.","Many science fiction writers have explored the idea of a generation ship or interstellar ark. Such a self-sustaining ship would serve as a small human colony and take centuries to thousands of years to reach its destination. The original occupants of the ship would grow old and die, leaving their descendants to continue traveling. This is how self-sustaining space habitats could save humanity from extinction and allow us to spread out to the rest of the universe.","While such a vision may sound impossible and even ridiculous, it is within the laws of physics for us to work towards. In 2000, the National Space Society conducted a study called the Roadmap to Space that outlined over 31 milestones, starting with dramatically lowering the cost of launches and ending with the survival of the human species via space settlements.","Ultimately, projects involving tapping into resources in space, such as growing plants on the moon, are critical steps towards this powerful vision for the future of space exploration, and of humanity.","Image Credit: Ilkin Zeferli / Shutterstock.com","Follow Raya:","Latest","In the Future, Everyone Might Use Quantum Computers","China Is Taking the Worldwide Lead in Wind Power","Synthetic Cell Component Expands the Code of Life in Complex Cells","RELATED","SETI Is Making a New Mixtape for Aliens, and You Can Contribute","Twins in Space: The Impact of Space Travel on Gene Expression","Why the Future of Solar Power Is from Space","Extending Human Longevity With Regenerative Medicine","Get the latest news from Singularity Hub!","Singularity University, Singularity Hub, Singularity Summit, SU Labs, Singularity Labs, Exponential Medicine, Exponential Finance and all associated logos and design elements are trademarks and/or service marks of Singularity Education Group."," 2019 Singularity Education Group.

Or youre a wizard.","For the rest of us, theres finally a transcribing solution. Its free, easy, and requires no fancy apps, AI, or downloadsjust Google Docs.","Docs, Googles free, cloud-based response to Microsoft Word, has a dictation software tool called Voice Typing (it comes pre-installed and requires no plugins). Voice typing is relatively self-explanatory: When you speak, the tool listens to you and transcribes what you say into a Google Doc. The feature is intended for people who cannot easily type or who prefer to dictate notes, but you can also use it to cut the time it takes to transcribe an audio recording down to nearly the same time as the recording itself. Basically, you listen to the recording (either on your phone or computer) via earphones and speak the recording out loud as you listen. The Voice Typing tool transcribes the words you speak.","When I used the tool to transcribe an hour-long interview, it was shockingly accurate. It spelled individuals names (like Sheryl Sandberg, or Sheila Heen) perfectly, knew when to use their versus theyre, and, when I finished a sentence, automatically corrected words it initially misheard. I finished the transcription in about 70 minutes. The toolproved equally successful when I spoke in Spanish, and when my colleagues tested it in German and Mandarin.","Heres the step-by-step guide to Voice Typing:","1. Find a quiet space","To transcribe with Voice Typing, listen to the recording via earphones, then speak the words you hear out loud. Voice Typing isnt advanced enough to transcribe a recording played via a speaker (be it your iPhone speaker or a more advanced speaker)it needs to hear a human voice, in a quiet area. If theres significant background noise, or many people speaking at once, the transcription will be less accurate.","2. Plug yourself in","Use earphones to listen to the recording, so that when you speak, the Voice Typing tool only hears your voice, not the recording.","3. Open a blank Google Doc","Go to the Google Doc home page, and click start a new document.","4. Open the Voice Typing tool","Under the Tools dropdown menu, select Voice Typing. Or use the shortcut Command+Shift+S to open the Voice Typing tool.","5. Ensure the Voice Typing button appears","When you click Voice Typing, the recording button will appear on the left side of your document:","6. Ensure your microphone is turned on and your language is set","As Google Help explains, to use voice typing or voice commands, your computer microphone needs to be on and working. Devices and microphones vary, so check your computer manual for instructions. Microphone settings are typically in theSystem Preferences on a Mac, or theControl Panelon a PC.","Voice Typing functions with nearly every language, including different accents and dialects (for example, the tool offers over 20 options for Spanish). Use the drop-down menu on the recording button to select the language youll be speaking in:","5. Click the recording button, and begin speaking","To begin transcribing, click the Voice Typing button. The microphone icon will turn red to indicate the tool is active. Begin listening to your audio recording via your headphones and speak along. As you speak, the Voice Tool will transcribe.","While youre transcribing, dont close the Google Doc window or click into another window. If you do, the Voice Tool will stop listening and transcribing.","Speak clearly, at a normal-to-loud tone, and avoid speaking very quickly. While the tool kept up with my quicker-than-average speaking speed, when I began speaking very quickly the transcription became less accurate.","Whenever the Voice Typing tool is active, you will see this red circle on the Google Doc windows tab:","To more clearly understand how this earphone-listening-transcribing transaction functions, watch this video of me transcribing live (its far easier than it sounds).","6. Watch along as you transcribe","Be sure to watch along as you speak and the tool transcribes, as occasional glitches occur. If the tool stops transcribing while you continue to speak, just click the Voice Typing tool button to turn it off, then click it again to turn it on. While I transcribed the hour-long recording, I had to turn the tool off then on again about three times, so to ensure it stayed accurate."],"targetCaptions":[]}

William Gray decided to see what Bautista would look like as the popular Batman villain Bane, and it certainly gave other fans something to think about. The design is pretty simple actually, utilizing the real Bautista's bulky frame and extensive ink to do most of the talking. The costume is also pretty simple, going with a black tank top but also wearing the Bane mask from the comics with some tweaks.","Those tweaks are pretty noticeable however, as the mask has cutouts around the eyes and mouth.

The roster of villains Gunn is reportedly using is quite the eclectic bunch, including villains like Polka-Dot and Ratcatcher, and having someone of Bane's caliber could be a great way to even it out with some mainstream power. Plus, having all that strength at your disposal probably wouldn't hurt either.","For now, we'll have to wait and see, but at least Gunn will be reteaming with Bautista on Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, which he was recently rehired for.","As for Bane, a new version of the villain was recently introduced on Gotham and is played by Shane West. This version seems to skew a bit more towards the Dark Knight Rises version from an aesthetic perspective, but like all Gotham characters features a unique flair all his own.","What do you think of this Bautista Bane?

Club, as well as the content of Peeles statement. - ED","With a $70 million opening weekend for Us, Jordan Peele is officially two for twoand in more ways than one. Both of Peeles feature directorial efforts have been horror films starring black actors in leading roles and theyve broken box office records upon release; one of themGet Outeven won an Oscar. And with his Twilight Zone reboot premiering next week on CBS All Access, Peele is quickly becoming one of the most prolific and acclaimed creatives on the planet, thanks in part to his focus on telling stories with diverse casts. So, what will he do next? According to The Hollywood Reporter, Peele says hes going to keep using his position to explore stories that arent led by white people.","Advertisement","While speaking to students at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Hollywood this week, Peele explained how his success has given him leverage in filmmakingspecifically with regards to casting black actors in leading roles. As Peele has previously stated, unlike Get Out, Us isnt about race;  it was also very important for him to have a Black family at the center of a horror film. Peeles talk at UCB seemed to extend that particular conversation, with the filmmaker explaining that he has no intention of making movies with white actors in leading roles anytime soon. I dont see myself casting a white dude as the lead in my movie, Peele said. Not that I dont like white dudes, but Ive seen that movie.","And its true: Weve all seen that movie. Thousands of times. Thats part of what makes Peeles filmmaking and his perspective so vital and fantastic, especially in Us, where the familys race isnt necessarily important to the story or understanding the films themes. Peele went on to acknowledge that hes currently in a position of privilege in Hollywood, and one that hes using to his advantage: The way I look at it, I get to cast black people in my movies. I feel fortunate to be in this position where I can say to Universal, I want to make a $20 million horror movie with a black family. And they say yes.","Up next for Peele is the aforementioned Twilight Zone reboot, which he hosts and executive produces, and features a diverse cast including Kumail Nanjiani, John Cho, Steven Yeun, DeWanda Wise, and Jessica Williams. Peeles Monkeypaw productions banner is also behind the upcoming remake of Candyman from director Nia DaCosta, starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Teyonah Parris.","Advertisement","Share This Story","Related Stories","We're sold on this insane Us theory","Jordan Peele recounts the first scary story he ever told","Jordan Peele's actual horror movie debut was this anti-smoking PSA","You may also like","Civilian on Fly-Along Accidentally Ejected from Fighter Jet","Odd Tease In The Division 2 Spills The Beans On The Next Assassin's Creed","E.

His Batman is why I do what I do. In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I fell in love with his comic book-accurate interpretation of the Caped Crusader. It was a breath of fresh air and it felt like we finally had the one true Batman.","Three years have quickly sped by and we're officially going to receive a new Batman for his next movie. Last night, Ben Affleck announced that he will not return as the Dark Knight in Matt Reeves' The Batman and now everyone's attention has moved towards wanting to know who the nextBruce Waynewill be. Matt Reeves is said to want an actor that's around 20 years younger than Affleck while Warner Bros. wants someone older. My guess is that Reeves wants a fresh start while the studio wants an older actor for crossover potential.","In this list, I will discuss the actors I think can replace Ben Affleck as Batman using the parameters that Matt Reeves and Warner Bros. want. Hit Next to see our picks to play the Batman.","Michael Fassbender","Michael Fassbender is an X-Men alum and no stranger to comic book franchises. The actor has shown multiple levels of range and could definitely handle the Batman/Bruce Wayne personality. If they go with the older range for the next Dark Knight, then Fassbender is probably one of the best choices to take over the role.","Ben Barnes","Ben Barnes is out of a job after The Punisher season 2 and he's one of the best actorsin thatseries. The second season tied up Barnes' arc on The Punisher and the actor has already told us that that he'd love to play the Caped Crusader. Barnes definitely has the pretty boylook going on for him and I wonder what his take on Bruce Wayne could be.","Ryan Gosling","I've said this before and I'll say it again: Ryan Gosling needs to star in a superhero movie. I've always thought Gosling would make a great Batman. Every role that he's done has shown us his capability and he could crush it as Bruce Wayne.","Jon Hamm","Jon Hamm is my top choice for an older Batman. If Warner Bros. wants to cast an older actor for crossover potential, Jon Hamm isthe studio's best bet. He has a similar look to Ben Affleck, and c'mon, the guy's look just screams Bruce Wayne.","Armie Hammer","Armie Hammer is 32 years old and was cast asthe Caped Crusaderin George Miller's Justice League: Mortal. That film will never see the light of day, but that doesnt mean that Hammer doesn't deserve a second shot at being the Batman. He's charming, broody and will probably give his all for this role. Armie Hammer is a great option because he's young enough for Matt Reeves and Warner Bros. could work in a way forhimto crossover with the rest of the DC Extended Universe.","Cesar Galvan","These Producers dont get it.   The first moviewas a disaster.  Nothing to the G.I. Joe i grew up watching.  The second one was more closer to the original source but they had killed most of the known characters.   They need to reboot and start all over and keep close to the source.  Yes, times have changed but the main core that will go to see this movie will be the adults that were fans of the cartoon when children.   They change the characters or the conflict between Cobra and its not G.I. Joe anymore.   Why is it so difficult to keep it close to the source?  G.I. Joe was alike a Seal Team 6.  The best of the best.  Why cant they go along with a semi-serious story and keeping the unique characters (one of the reasons i liked G.i. Joe).  It does not have to be corny.","Agreed.and especially hate Snake Eyes origin in those films.

One...","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Oxford University Press'sAcademic Insights for the Thinking World","Sorry About That: The Language of Public Apology","Ive noticed myself saying yeah no.","The expression came up in a class one day, when I had asked students to bring in examples of language variation. One student suggested yeah no as an example of not-quite standard California English.","California, it seems, gets the credit or blame for everything. But yeah no is not California English and its not just something young people say. Its been around for a while and is used by males and females, young and old. I began to notice yeah no in the speech of others and soon in my own speech as well. Perhaps I had been using it all along and was just now becoming more aware of it.","When I mentioned her use of yeah no to a Victorianist colleague, she suggested the usage might have come from a BBC character on the show Little Britain, which ran on television from 2003 to 2005. The character Vicky Pollard is a teen slacker stereotype, prone to saying Yeah but no but yeah but. The catchphrase is meant to convey inarticulateness. And the Urban Dictionary gives no less than six definitions of Yeah no including this one: An annoying and obnoxious phrase uttered by the simple minded, who dont think before they speak.","Yeah no.","It is wrong to think of yeah no as an oxymoron and a sign of inarticulate confusion. Yeah no is what linguists call a discourse marker. Discourse markers are usually short and sometime vague-seeming parts of a sentence which serve semantic, expressive, and practical functions in speech. They can indicate assent or dissent (or sometimes both). They can indicate attention, sarcasm, hedging, self-effacement, or face-saving.","It is wrong to think of yeah no as an oxymoron and a sign of inarticulate confusion.","Examples of yeah no abound and there is quite a bit of linguistic commentary, including posts by Stephen Dodson on his Language Hat blog, by Mark Liberman on the Language Log, and by Ben Yagoda in The Chronicle of Higher Education Lingua Franca column. And yeah no is not just an English phenomenon. Some of the commentary points to other languages with similar discourse markers, including Da nyet in Russian, oui non in French, and ja nein in German, and more. When I mentioned yeah no to a colleague recently back from a sabbatical in South African, she pointed me to the South African English expression ja-nee.","Some of the earliest published discussions of English yeah no come from Australia, which may mean that the English usage grew there or that Australian researchers noticed it first (or both). In their 2002 article, Kate Burridge and Margaret Florey first explored the variety of uses to which yeah no could be put. One is to agree with what has just been said before adding another pointan amplification or clarification. Here is an example in which the second speaker is agreeing and amplifying:","Do you eat meat?","Yeah no, I eat anything.","But yeah no can also be used to acknowledge and disagree:","Do you eat meat?","Yeah no, I eat fish and sometimes chicken.","The answer assents to eating some meat (fish and chicken) but clarifies that red meat is not on the menu.","Another use of yeah no is to signal hesitation and imply mixed feelings, as in this bit of dialogue from Joe Penhalls play Landscape with Weapon:","Dan: Hi.","Ned: Hi Dan. How you doing?","Dan: OK. How are you doing?","Ned: Yeah no, Im good.","Or this, from Kekla Magoons book 37 Things I Love (in no particular order):","Evan  clears his throat: So I guess youre not going to the graduation dance?","Oh, I had totally forgotten about it. Yeah, no. The funeral and everything is that day. So I cant.","Yeah confirms the not going (yeah, Im not going) and no emphasizes the fact that the character cant go.","And yeah no can be a way of accepting a compliment, as in this Australian example from Erin Moores University of Melbourne honors thesis Yeah-No: A Discourse Marker in Australian English. Complimented on his teams success (Youre doing a very good job at the moment?), a coach responds by accepting the compliment but also deflecting it.","Well yeah no, it is pleasing the boys have had a good year, but um as Ive as Ive said to the boys, its a new year and everyones trying to knock you off, and weve gotta be up to it.","The discourse marker yeah no is here to stay, and today, you can even buy Yeah no tee-shirts and coffee mugs.","Featured image credit: Conversation on swing by Bewakoof.com Official.

You could be getting a 16% return on your money right now, and its not that hard to do.","As Mark Cuban, the Shark Tank star, billionaire entrepreneur, and NBA franchise owner explains, just pay off your debts.","Americans carry an enormous amount of personal debt. The personal finance site NerdWallet put our revolving credit card balance at $420.22 billion in late 2018.","Thats not considering total credit card debt, which is $944 billion, or the multiple trillions in mortgage, auto and student loan debt. The revolving number is just the credit card debt we carry from month to month.","It works out to $6,929 per U.S. household. Meanwhile, according to Credit Karma, the average rate on that debt was 15.96%.","Pay that off and you stop losing nearly 16% in compounding negative returns.","The reason for that is whatever interest you have  it might be a student loan with a 7% interest rate  if you pay off that loan, youre making 7%, Cuban said.","And so thats your immediate return, which is a lot safer than trying to pick a stock, or trying to pick real estate or whatever it may be.","Juicy returns","Do you think you can find a stock that will return 16% in the next year? Do you think your retirement portfolio will grow that quickly?","Of course not. Whatever short-run investment you make that promises juicy returns forces you to run the risk of equally powerful losses.","Long-term investments are safer, but there you have to contend with what academics call reversion to the mean, the tendency for investments to average out over the years.","Stocks from 1950 to 2018 returned 11.1% annually. Bonds returned 5.8%. If you had a 50/50 stock and bond portfolio, you averaged 8.8%.","Hows that 16% looking now?","Look, its hard to pay off debts. Being debt-free (or at least credit-card debt free) requires immediate sacrifice.","Thats vacations not taken. Car repairs delayed. Cooking at home and not relaxing in a restaurant on the weekend or for workday lunches.","Yet the cost of not paying off your high-interest debts is astronomical.","Lets say you have exactly the typical American household credit balance of $6,929 and carry it for 20 years at 16%. You end up paying $135,038.","Now lets say you invested that amount instead and earned 8.8% over 20 years. You end up with $37,486.","You should invest, the earlier the better. But, truthfully, the math strongly advises that you pay off any high-interest debt you carry as soon as humanly possible.","A positive force","The power of compounding returns can be a positive force in your financial life. Even if youre starting late and retirement is only a decade off, starting is the key.","Most people underestimate how long they might live. They spend today like there is no tomorrow. If they invest at all, they make short-run bets rather than taking the safer, more compelling long-term investment.","And, too often, we discount the value of mathematically sound financial planning.","There are many unknowns about the stock market, the economy, politics and world events. Mostly, though, stocks go up regardless of the headlines.","Meanwhile, the things we can estimate well  our personal indebtedness, housing costs, health expenses, Social Security and the cost of living  we tend to ignore.","A better retirement plan process takes into account all of the knowns and compares them to likely long-term investment scenarios. By working with a qualified financial planning professional, you can settle your mind about retirement after just a few consultations.","And, yes, paying down debt will be part of that plan. As Cuban argues, the best way to get ahead is to make sure youre not falling behind thanks to high-cost debt.","Mitch\n                                                    Tuchman","Mitch Tuchman brings the low-cost, scientific investment approach used by elite pensions and endowments to everyday retirement investors through Rebalance.

It could also allow Ozil to reignite his career elsewhere.","Mohamed Elneny (Arsenal)","Elneny has made just four Premier League appearances under Emery this season and did not even make the matchday squad for both legs of their Europa League last-16 triumph over Rennes earlier this month.","One of Arsene Wengers last acts as Arsenal manager was to hand Elneny a new contract until 2022, but the Egypt midfielder might need to reconsider his future this summer.","Divock Origi (Liverpool)","Despite deputising for the injured Roberto Firmino against Watford and Everton recently, Origi is unlikely to ever nail down a regular starting place under Jurgen Klopp.","Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane have restricted Origis playing time this season.","A summer move, maybe to a mid-table Premier League club, would do him the world of good.","Simon Mignolet (Liverpool)","Liverpools third-round exits in both domestic cup competitions have seen Mignolet play just twice for the club this season.","Alisson has featured in every minute of Liverpools 31 Premier League games since signing in a 67million deal from Roma last summer.","And his impressive form could force Mignolet to end his six-year affiliation with the Reds.","Vincent Janssen (Tottenham)","Janssens Tottenham days are clearly numbered. He is yet to make a single appearance for Mauricio Pochettinos side this season and his only playing time since his return from injury has come with the Under-23s team.","He was linked with moves to Crystal Palace and Cardiff in the January transfer window, but a move abroad seems the most likely option when the transfer window reopens.","Victor Wanyama (Tottenham)","After featuring heavily in his 2016/17 debut season with Tottenham, various injuries have affected his first-team chances.","The Kenya midfielder has started just two league games this term and is behind Harry Winks, Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko in the pecking order.","If Wanyama was to leave Spurs, he would not be short of suitors.","Danny Drinkwater (Chelsea)","It is hard to believe that Drinkwater, a Premier League title winner with Leicester only three seasons ago, has not played a second of competitive football in the 2018/19 campaign.","Bought for 35million in 2017, the 29-year-old has been an expensive flop.","Despite his lack of game-time, Drinkwater does not seem to be in any hurry to push for a move.","In December, when asked about the England midfielders future, Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri said: I dont know. It depends on the club, its up to him.","Ethan Ampadu (Chelsea)","Chelseas two-window transfer ban could affect what they do with their young players next season.","Renowned for sending their young stars on loan across the country, Ampadu could do with a temporary move away from Stamford Bridge.","At the age of 18, he has won six caps for Wales and is highly-rated by Dragons boss Ryan Giggs.","Claudio Bravo (Manchester City)","Manchester Citys No.2 goalkeeper Bravo was on the bench for the clubs first two games of the season before suffering a serious achilles tendon injury.","In his absence, 20-year-old stopper Arijanet Muric impressed in Citys run to the Carabao Cup final, including two penalty shootout saves in their quarter-final win over Leicester.","Murics form could see Pep Guardiola part ways with Bravo, who has just one year left on his contract.","Phil Foden (Manchester City)","This would only be a loan move after the youngster signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal in December. Citys array of talent in midfield has seen the 18-year-old start just seven times this season.","A full season, playing regular football would be hugely beneficial to the England Under-21 international.","FOLLOW talkSPORT","Services"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Yet its a condition that often goes untreated because new mothers fear being stigmatized if they report symptoms.","Brexanolone is the first drug developed by and approved from Sage Therapeutics. The Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech company will market the new medicine under the brand name Zulresso.","Unlock this article by subscribing to STAT Plus and enjoy your first 30 days free!","What is it?","STAT Plus is a premium subscription that delivers daily market-moving biopharma\tcoverage and in-depth science reporting from a team with decades of industry experience.","What's included?","About the Author","Adam Feuerstein","Senior Writer, Biotech","Adam is STATs national biotech columnist, reporting on the intersection of biotech and Wall Street.","Tags","biotechnology","Boston","FDA","women's health","Leave a Comment Cancel reply","60 hour infusion?? Thats 2 1/2 days! Really? Are they hooked up the entire time? Thats depressing..","There is a gold rush on at the FDA.  As long as industry insiders, former lobbyists and people whose only function is to ensure pharma profits, there will marketer generated hype like this.  The most obvious suspicion would be the 36 thousand dollar price tag.  The industry funded studies  and RCTs can be easily gamed in our current alternate fact environment.  We should be doubtful that the positions that were supposed to be scientifically evaluating these claims, are filled with the most qualified people.\nIt is really easy to find self selected subjects who would report and improvement,  for a disorder that is hard to evaluate, treat or anticipate.  Infusions that last for days, might provide a break or relief,  that would only give the appearance that this stuff might work.   It does not take much  evidence, since the only factor here is increasing profits, not benefiting women with Postpartum disorder.","The cost of this medication alone would lead to under-reporting and deliberate misdiagnosis of the disorder.    The only women who could afford this would already have nannies, and household help, giving them time to adjust.","Another Benzodiazapine to destroy more lives. This is a travesty that any doctor with a conscience would ever consider prescribing this drug to a new mother. We as a community can help women with Postpartum depression by outreach and providing support that is needed. Where did the idea come from that some pharmaceutical drug can fix things? They have never fixed anything and never will. The quote unquote relief that people receive temporarily from these drugs is never worth the risk. I speak from first hand knowledge, and if women are prescribed this drug they will end up damaged and/or dead from the effects of the drug on the body and possibly by suicide. There is no place for the use of Benzos outside of a closely medically monitored environment.","Please disregard my comment. I was didnt read before commenting I went based on what I heard. After reading I would have commented a bit differently but I still do not approve of this medication.","How does this effect the suckling child?","When people are in an uproar over the cost of insulin and other life saving medicines, I find it a tad arrogant to list the price of this med at $34,000. Will anyone actually pay that much? Not once the activists force it to be covered by insurance, which they will.  But as in everything covered by insurance, we will ALL pay for it by increased premiums, higher copays and coinsurance. Now lets add the cost (and time commitment) of 60 hrs in the hospital and the only women who are going to use this medication are already well-to-do, women who already have access and no time constraints to nonmedical treatments such as yoga and meditation.\nIs there a need for safe, effective meds for treatment of PPD? Yes.  Are there meds out there that have been useful? Yes (some even generic). But they are not officially approved.  That takes time and research, something no pharma company is going to invest in when a drug is near the end of its profit life span.  So the research falls to NIH or NIMH, oh wait. Trump wants to reduce funding to those unbiased, research organizations.\nAnd now you know, in a thumbnail sketch why pharma releases new meds with borderline efficacy at HUGE price tags. The system is set up so they can!","No comment is complete these days without some mentioning Trump. TDS.","Excuse me. I cannot find any published paper describing the trial. I did find a press release. This said the trial lasted 30 days and included 151 patients. One patient on drug had to discontinue due to un-described side effects.","Game changer? How would one know? What game? Con game? Certainly not a science game.","FYI\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31551-4/fulltext","The drugs name is brexanolone. To be added to the long list of compounds, not protected by patent (like Firdapse), that could be bought in bulk for little money from chemical suppliers.","You are sooo correct!! there were 2 trials. In trial 2 PLACEBO was better than drug at 30 days.","Table 2. The text doesnt report this. It says These significant increases in CGI-I response occurred as early as 36 h and were sustained at day 7. But the protocol called for analysis at 30 days. The 30 day data was noted for the study where there was  a small but stat. sig effect in favor of drug. Somehow the authors failed to write up the 30  day data. (Its in the graph). So as is typical of industry studies the results are intentionally spun to help sales not patient care.","If a student of mine did this I would fail them for an ethical violation. Lets see what UNC does.","Sounds great until I saw the price tag. Hopefully it will come down with time. In the meantime, any good functional medicine physician can most likely guide you to helpful supplements. Through Groupon and Meetup, you can explore meditation, yoga and sound therapies (like the gong bath shown in last weeks episode of Greys Anatomy) to help reboot healthy pathways and help\nget your neurotransmitters working in harmony. Sounds crazy. Tried it a month ago. Well worth a shot.","Outrageous. They are going to hospitalize new moms and charge $34,000 plus hospitalization costs for a drug that barely works better than a placebo. How did this get approved? Birth control pills (skipping the placebo week) to even out the mood swings and anti anxiety meds as needed are quite effective for PPD. But theres no profit in promoting cheap existing drugs.","Agree- how about providing these women with some natural progesterone, the hormone that takes a severe dip after childbirth. Oh wait, big pharma wouldnt profit.","What of toxicity to a baby nursing?","A brilliant example of how the FDA is promoting the approval of fake and/or worthless medicines.\nTwo thirds of the drug effects can be ascribed to a placebo effects. That is, only a minor fraction can be ascribed to the drug. And considering the burdensome administration protocol, it is hardly justifiable. In addition, the placebo effect is consistently long lasting, supporting the view that postpartum depression is mostly a psychological affliction, rather than physiological.","the view that postpartum depression is mostly a psychological affliction, rather than physiological\nIm going to be immature here, but HAHAHAHAHAHA! Spoke like someone who has never experienced the hormonal whiplash and insane physiological changes that accompany pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum experience.\nCertainly there are psychological aspects to most forms of depression, but the idea that severe PPD is not physiological is laughable.","the consideration comes from the results of their own clinical trial.\nNot from your single personal experience, Genius!","Recommended Stories","Listen: Cheaper insulin, the next Juul, and diagnosing disease with sound","By Damian Garde, Rebecca Robbins,  and Adam Feuerstein","The biotech scorecard for the second quarter: 18 stock-moving events to watch","By Adam Feuerstein","advertisement","A small drug maker accuses Soon-Shiong of masterminding a catch-and-kill scheme","By Ed Silverman","Can CRISPR improve on natures own bacteria-killing phages?","By Eric Boodman","In biotechs biggest hub, companies open their labs to an unlikely inspector: the citys veterinarian","By Kate Sheridan","Sign up for our Daily Recap newsletter","A roundup of STATs top stories of the day in science and medicine"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Another Trump campaign leader, Manafort's former longtime aide Rick Gates, will reveal whether he is still providing information to the probe. And Trump's first national security advisor, Michael Flynn, will give a status update to the judge who had previously accused him of arguably selling out his own country.","Two deadlines are also set this week for Republican political operative Roger Stone, among the most recent of Trump's associates to be hit with charges in Mueller's probe of Russian meddling, and possible Trump campaign collusion, during the 2016 election. Before new details about his upcoming trial can be hashed out, Stone's attorneys will have to explain how the rerelease of his book, \"The Myth of Russian Collusion,\" squares with his strict gag order in the case.","Mueller's busy week arrives amid persistent speculation that the investigation may be nearing its conclusion. Lawmakers of both parties on Capitol Hill have called for the summary findings of the investigation to be made public without redactions.","Since the start of the investigation, Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has decried the probe as a \"witch hunt.\"","Here's what's coming up this week:","Paul Manafort","Manafort, 69, was already sentenced last week to less than four years in prison in a case brought by Mueller's prosecutors in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. But he will be sentenced by another judge Wednesday in Washington, D.C., district court.","Some legal experts predict that that judge, Amy Berman Jackson, will be more likely to give Manafort a harsher sentence than the judge in the Virginia case, T.S. Ellis, who had previously expressed his displeasure with the special counsel's legal tactics.","So-called statutory maximum rules set a 10-year cap on the prison sentence Jackson can impose in Manafort's case. Mueller's prosecutors, who suffered a bruising defeat after failing to secure a lengthy prison term for Manafort in Virginia, may argue in D.C. that Manafort's two sentences should be served consecutively, rather than simultaneously.","Many legal experts were shocked by Manafort's relatively light first prison sentence of 47 months  a length of time significantly below the 19-to-24 years suggested by federal guidelines. Manafort was convicted on eight criminal counts including bank fraud and tax fraud, which mostly related to work he had done for a pro-Russia political party years before he joined Trump's campaign.","Ellis had previously accused Mueller of levying the finance charges against Manafort in order to pressure him into cooperating with the Russian interference probe. The judge had also taken a hostile tone toward Mueller's team before and during the trial.","Jackson, in contrast, had ordered Manafort jailed pending trial after Mueller accused him of tampering with potential witnesses. Manafort has been detained in an Alexandria jail since June.","\"I don't believe Judge Berman Jackson will make any of the statements Judge Ellis did regarding the special counsel's motivations,\" former federal prosecutor Anthony Capozzolo told CNBC. \"I thought Judge Ellis' comments were perplexing and confounding.\"","Richard Gates","Gates, who testified against his former business partner Manafort at trial last summer and has cooperated extensively with the special counsel, will file a joint status report with Mueller on Friday.","Gates, 46, has had his sentencing on charges of lying to investigators and conspiracy delayed multiple times since he pleaded guilty in early 2018.","In January, Mueller told the judge that Gates \"continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process at this time.\"","Michael Flynn","Prosecutors and Flynn's attorneys are set to update Judge Emmet Sullivan in a status report Wednesday, where they might decide on whether Flynn is set to be sentenced.","Flynn's initial sentencing date in December was pushed off during a dramatic hearing in D.C. federal court, where Sullivan blasted the 60-year-old retired lieutenant general for his crime of lying to investigators about his communications with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took office.","\"Arguably, you sold your country out,\" Sullivan said at the hearing. The judge had suggested that Flynn could get a lighter sentence if the decision was delayed until after he finished cooperating with Mueller.","\"The court likes to be in a position to say there is nothing else this defendant can to do help the United States of America,\" Sullivan said.","The status of Gates' and Flynn's cases could provide one of the strongest indications yet about how near the Russia probe is to completion.","If their sentencing hearings continue to be adjourned, or if the special counsel says that they are still providing information about ongoing investigations, then \"It's likely that Mueller's investigation will be continuing for some time,\" Capozzolo said.","Roger Stone","Lawyers for Stone, 66, were ordered by Jackson in D.C. to explain by Monday Stone's efforts to comply with his gag order, as well as shed light on \"unexplained inconsistencies\" regarding some statements made to the court.","The gag order on Stone, a self-described political dirty trickster, had been strengthened after he posted an image on Instagram showing Jackson's face next to the cross hair of a rifle's scope.","Following that action, Jackson learned that Stone was rereleasing his book, \"The Myth of Russian Collusion,\" which criticizes Mueller.","Jackson also asked the defense attorneys to provide a list of other information, including records related to Stone's book deal.","If Jackson decides that Stone has disobeyed her gag order, she could revoke his $250,000 signature release bond and order him held without bail until his trial on charges of lying to Congress and witness tampering.","That all precedes a status conference on Thursday morning, where the parties in the case are expected to hash out details related to Stone's trial, which is yet to be scheduled.","\"I think Stone's been playing with fire for a while,\" said Carl Tobias, a law professor and federal courts expert at the University of Richmond.","Jackson \"has plenty of discretion to do whatever she thinks is necessary\" to keep the trial from being tainted, Tobias said  which could theoretically involve revoking Stone's bail and sending him to jail pending trial.","But that \"does seem fairly drastic,\" Tobias added.","Playing","Share this video...","Watch Next...","News Tips","Got a confidential news tip?

Thats because its zoned for industrial uses.","The company uses most of its warehouse space in the industrial park as a commissary to make mixes for its baked goods, which are then baked at its cafes around the region.","Neate said he assumed he could open a cafe adjacent to the commissary with limited seating, but he recently found out that wasnt allowed.","The zoning allows it to have a sales area for items produce on site, but as soon as you add chairs it is considered a restaurant or cafe, city planner Grant Taylor told Neate in an email.","The current land-use rules in Big Bend are in place to ensure that the proposed restaurant is not of a broad orientation, would draw customers from outside the industrial area, and is not in close proximity to any existing restaurants/cafes already established in a given area, Taylor wrote.","A comprehensive and detailed analysis of the area determined a new cafe wasnt needed, Taylor wrote. He pointed out that the nearby Conte Foods Deli already serves food.","Similar cafe proposals have already been turned down in the area, Taylor wrote.","The overall objective is that industrial-designated areas, like the business parks in the Big Bend, remain industrial in nature, Taylor wrote. As more commercial premises are located in industrial areas, this industrial nature is further diminished.","But Neate said JJ Bean is offering a distinct service lacking in the area, especially its award-winning espresso.","He said the cafe has been open since September and new customers are surprised to find a bare concrete floor when they walk in.","Theyre going What? What do you mean? he said.","The cafe, currently offering only to-go service, is now asking customers to sign a petition asking the city to reconsider, Neate said.","In an email, Taylor told Burnaby Now JJ Bean is welcome to make a formal rezoning application at any time.","On submission of an application, a report would be prepared to seek council consideration, he wrote.","Carly Fryer works in the area and said she was happy to see JJ Bean open up nearby. The cafe fills a niche lacking in the area, she said.","The nearby Market Crossing strip mall is too far away to be able to walk there and back during her lunch break and the closer Conte Foods doesnt provide the same items as JJ Bean, she said.","If the cafe had seating, it would provide a much-needed third place where people can step away from the office and socialize, Fryer said.","RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","This incredible chocolate art installation launches in Metro Vancouver this month","Canadian Arctic has all the mineral ingredients for prized blue gemstones","Spraying for Japanese beetle in Vancouver parks starts this weekend","TOP POSTS OF ALL TIME","8 sharks you didnt know lived in BC waters","25 Amazing Colourized Photos of Vancouver","6 FREE campsites you should check out this summer","13 day trips to take this weekend","EDITOR PICKS","5 things you didnt know about the Fraser River","This outdoor bed cinema is coming to Vancouver this summer","Meet B.C.s best wedding photographer","North Vancouver shooting sends woman to hospital","POPULAR POSTS","600,000 People are Networking With This New App","Never-before-seen video of driving through Vancouver 50 years ago","Can they search your phone at the Canadian border?","POPULAR CATEGORY","We celebrate Vancouver lifestyle and culture while keeping you up to date on the news of the day."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Why not the US?","targetDescription":"A mass shooting in New Zealand has led to an assault-weapon ban six days later, drawing contrasts with the US.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Accessibility links","BBC News Navigation","Share this with","Email","Facebook","Messenger","Messenger","Twitter","Pinterest","WhatsApp","LinkedIn","Copy this link","These are external links and will open in a new window","Six days after the Christchurch mosque attack, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a ban on \"military-style\" semi-automatic rifles, prompting questions in the US.","Following a series of mass shootings in the US in recent years, there has been little in the way of sweeping gun-control reforms.","On the federal level, at least, the interest and attention in new legislation has led to almost no action in decades, despite numerous polls showing widespread public support for measures like strengthened background checks and banning certain types of high-capacity gun magazines and military-style assault rifles.","The Trump administration has issued a regulatory ban on bump-stock modifications that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns, and there have been some tweaks to the background check database for gun-store purchases.","Last March, Donald Trump entertained the notion of more ambitious, \"comprehensive\" legislation, telling senators pro-gun lobbyists had little power over him. But there's been no such talk from the president since.","Content is not available","Part of the reason New Zealand is ability to move quickly, of course, is that it's a parliamentary democracy, ensuring that the government is controlled entirely by one party or a politically compatible coalition. That's not the only explanation for why the US has charted a different course, however.","Here are five big obstacles that stand in the way of the kind of the US taking the kind of quick, major changes to firearm policy being advanced in New Zealand.","The NRA","The National Rifle Association is one of the most influential interest groups in US politics - not just because of the money it spends on lobbying politicians, but also because of the engagement of its five million members.","It opposes most proposals to strengthen firearm regulations and is behind efforts at both the federal and state levels to roll back many existing restrictions on gun ownership.","In 2016 the NRA spent $4m on lobbying and direct contributions to politicians as well as more than $50m on political advocacy, including an estimated $30m to help elect Donald Trump president.","Its overall annual budget is roughly $250m, allocated to educational programmes, gun facilities, membership events, sponsorships, legal advocacy and related efforts.","More than just the numbers, however, the NRA has developed a reputation in Washington as a political force that can make or break even the strongest politicians.","It grades politicians on their votes and directs its resources and those of its membership - both financial and organisational - to supporting its fiercest advocates and defeating staunch opponents.","As one former Republican congressman told the New York Times in 2013: \"That was the one group where I said, 'As long as I'm in office, I'm not bucking the NRA.'\" Last March the president said he wasn't \"afraid\" of the NRA - but that was a rhetorical flourish that has not resurfaced.","Could it change? Gun-control groups, backed by wealthy benefactors like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have become more organised in recent years, attempting to match the NRA's political might. They actually outspent the NRA in the 2018 mid-terms, during which some prominent pro-gun-control Democrats won close elections. The NRA's revenues dropped $56m in 2017, driven largely by a decline in membership dues. It still brought in $378.1m that year, however, ensuring that it will be the biggest single player in the firearm debate.","Gerrymandering","For the first time in eight years, Democrats have control of the House of Representatives - and their success in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections was fuelled largely by victories in suburban swing districts. In Atlanta, for instance, a gun-control activist won one of the closest races of the election, unseating an incumbent Republican.","Despite these advances for the party, the House electoral playing field is still tilted toward Republicans, who tend to be for gun rights. Due to the way the lines of House congressional districts are drawn, many by Republican-controlled state legislatures, there are more seats that tilt to the right than the left. While 2018 was a Democratic wave election, political gravity may eventually reassert itself, giving control of the chamber back to conservatives.","Demographics also play a part in the pro-gun sentiment in the House, as there are more rural districts with higher levels of gun ownership than there are urban ones. Racking up big pro-gun-control majorities in urban areas does little to change the political realities in the House.","For the moment, however, the initiative is with Democrats, and 2019 marked a significant step forward for gun-control proponents in Congress. One of their first actions was to pass a bill in the House requiring comprehensive background checks of private gun sales, including those that take place at gun shows. Previously the requirement to run the name of gun purchasers in a federal database was limited only to registered gun dealers.","Prior to 2019, attempts to pass new federal laws regulating firearms had been over before they ever really begin, stymied by House Republicans. In June 2016 a group of Democratic politicians staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to protest over the Republican House leadership's decision not to hold a vote on two gun-control bills.","Could it change? The House of Representatives was once one of the biggest obstacles to federal gun-control legislation. It no longer is - for now. With every House seat up for election every two years, and an American electorate that has proven fickle, the door could slam shut again with little advanced notice.","The filibuster","Now that gun-control bills have hopes in the House of Representatives, the Senate - where the rural-urban divide plays itself out on the state level - becomes the biggest obstacle to legislative success. States dominated by big-city voters, such as New York, Massachusetts or California, are outnumbered by rural and Southern states with pro-gun sentiments.","The rules of the Senate can also thwart efforts to enact more stringent firearm regulation, thanks to the \"filibuster\" - a procedural hurdle that means most major pieces of legislation need the backing of 60 out of 100 senators to pass, rather than a simple 51-vote majority.","In 2013, following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, it appeared that efforts to strengthen gun-purchase background checks had significant bipartisan support in the Senate. After a concerted lobbying effort by the NRA, however, the bill received only 56 votes in favour, four short of the mark necessary to break the filibuster.","No gun-control measure has come close to passage since then. At least for the moment, there appears little chance the Senate will take up the House-passed universal background check bill, despite indications that a majority of senators would vote in favour of it.","Could it change? Mr Trump has been a vocal proponent of doing away with the Senate filibuster, as he views it as an obstacle to enacting his legislative agenda. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have made similar calls. A majority of senators are on the record against changing the rules, however.","The courts","With Congress deadlocked on new gun legislation, left-leaning US states have taken a greater role in implementing gun-control measures.","After the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, 21 states passed new gun laws, including imposing assault weapons bans in Connecticut, Maryland and New York.","Some of the laws have run up against another barrier, however - the US judicial system. In recent years the Supreme Court has twice ruled that the right to own personal weapons such as handguns is enshrined in the constitution.","The Second Amendment says that \"a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\".","Gun-control activists point to the introductory clause as evidence that the amendment was meant primarily to create a \"well regulated\" militia. In 2008, however, a sharply divided court held that the Second Amendment provides a broad right to firearm ownership that prohibits stringent registration requirement for personal weapons.","Since then, lower courts have considered challenges to state-imposed assault weapon bans, registration requirements and open-carry prohibitions.","Could it change? Trump-appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have a record of viewing Second Amendment rights broadly. The president is filling out the ranks of the lower courts with pro-gun-rights judges. If anything, the judiciary is moving to the right on this issue. In the autumn, the Supreme Court will consider a challenge to a New York City law restricting how handgun owners can transport their firearms. Gun-control advocates fear the high court is poised to strike another blow against state and local regulations.","The enthusiasm gap","Perhaps the single biggest obstacle to new gun-control laws at the national level is that opponents tend to hold fiercely to their beliefs, while support for new regulation tends to ebb and flow around each new instance of violence.","The NRA's strategy, and that of pro-gun politicians, is to wait out the storm - to delay legislative efforts until attention turns elsewhere and the outcry fades.","Pro-gun politicians offer their thoughts and prayers, observe moments of silence and order flags flown half-staff. Then, in the quiet, legislative efforts are deferred and ultimately derailed.","The mass student-led protests following the Parkland school shooting focused white-hot attention on the issue for a time, but the marches have died down and the changes to gun laws, at least on the federal level, have been minimal.","Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters \"there's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country\".","Mr Trump  said \"we will be talking about gun laws as time goes by\".","As time goes by. As that song from the film Casablanca says, it's still the same old story.","Could it change? According to one poll during the 2016 presidential campaign, guns were an important issue for both Democrats and Republicans. That could be a reflection of that year's mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub or the first indication of a new trend.","Follow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.","Related Topics","Share this story        Aboutsharing","Top Stories","The chancellor believes an agreement can be reached with Labour despite no talks planned this weekend.","Features","The NFL star abandoned on London's streets","Unforgettable TV - Our Planet, Attenboroughs Netflix debut","The treasure hunt that gripped a nation","How did the Kardashians make their millions?","The women divided by Brexit","Israel election: Who are the key candidates?","The 'womanspreading' placard that caused fury in Pakistan","Secrets of Race Across the World","How Algeria's army sacrificed a president to keep power","Elsewhere on the BBC","Legendary live gigs","Five life-changing concerts from the music world","Daily news briefing direct to your inbox","Sign up for our newsletter","BBC News Navigation","BBC News Services","Explore the BBC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

As cosplay grows in size and scope, though, some cosplayers are finding that the same ol same ol just isnt enough anymore.","At the same time as this years Katsuconone of the most important cosplay shows on the calendarthere was another event called SClass Weekend, which attracted some of the biggest cosplayers and best photographers in the scene. It wasnt part of the official Katsucon schedule, however; this event had been made for cosplayers, by cosplayers.","Sclass is the brainchild of Sean McCoy, a former cosplayer himself who now works as support for his fiance Natasha Bindi Smalls Spokish. If youre wondering what that means, it means Sean looks after everything Natasha cant while shes in costume, which ranges from scheduling to logistics to attaching/repairing armour to assisting with equipment for photo shoots.","Something started to get to me as we went to convention after convention - theyre all the goddamn same, he says. Sure, maybe this one has a cool guest, or maybe that one is more focused on gaming, or anime, hey this one has a waterslide! But the formula is 95% the same across all of them: expensive rooms, expensive badges, long lines, panels (of varying quality), expensive vendor booths, crowds, and venue staff who would likely stab you in your sleep, given the chance.","Advertisement","Id grown, my needs had changed, but these conventions were mostly carbon-copies of themselves year after year.","While the conventions themselves have been treading water for the past few years, the cosplay community has been finding fun in new places. Big parties during and after shows, mostly completely unaffiliated with the actual con, have over the last few years become highlights for cosplayers, a perfect way to unwind after a long weekend in costume.","And as weve seen with our Cosplay Showcase features, cosplayers are becoming increasingly interested in presenting the scene as one thats able to do more than just dress up. Cosplayers and photographers in 2019 are constantly pushing the envelope when it comes to how outfits are made, the themes inspiring them and the way their cosplay is captured.","Inspired by this, and in his capacity as someone who was now more interested in the logistics and schedules of cosplayers than cosplay itself, Sean started asking cons if he could help them start setting up official parties and extracurricular photo shoots. He was met with a no at almost every turn, with hotels and cons that have their own show floors, bookings and bars to worry about not interested. Ive even received cease-and-desist letters from major hotel chains when convention organizers wanted to snuff-out what I was working on, he says.","Video by Mineralblu","Advertisement","Convinced that conventions werent going to help him, Sean decided to take matters into his own hands, and the perfect place to start was going to be Katsucon 2019. Held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, theres nothing wrong with Katsucons venue, or the photo shoots that came out of it.","But its also pretty close to the new MGM National Harbor resort, and thats fancier, so McCoy reached out to management to ask about the possibility of running some premium cosplay events over the same weekend as Katsucon.","The MGM was happy to oblige, offering use of its ballroom and the Voltaggio Brothers restaurant to cosplayers and photographers. That sounds...weird, but the VBs main selling point is that it contains a number of high-class themed rooms, each of them unique in look and design, which made for a perfect location for photoshoots and a welcome, highbrow departure from the usual con backgrounds of hotel carpet and handrails.","Youre looking at the results of that shoot throughout this post, with photographers Anna Fischer, Mineralblu, Kayhettin, Martin Wong, Matthew Mutch and Paul Hillier all there taking glamour shots and video. Theres no escaping loud carpets and glass balustrades in regular con photos, but what everyone was able to pull off here is closer to a high fashion magazine shoot than anything you see coming out of major cosplay events.","Advertisement","Of course the shoots were only half the point of SClass, with the other main focus being the party that cosplayers could enjoy afterwards. Like the ballroom and restaurant, SCLass afterparty was also held at the MGM, which was a far more elegant experience than most cosplayers are used to from convention centre or hotel bars.","Its important to point out that SClass wasnt designed to compete with Katsucon, or somehow replace it, as nearly everybody involved spent the weekend alternating between both venues. Instead it was designed to compliment it, adding a luxury top tier to the con that the events name implies.","It was also 100% free for everyone involved, and was open to anyone who wanted to make the trek and take part.","With Katsucons SClass having wound up a big success, Sean and everyone else involved have plans to run similar events at other big shows throughout the year.","My goal is to work with venues and sponsors in the future to continue events like this past one - professional, fun, unique. Id like to be able to find a budget to get these amazing creators paid for participating, and do even cooler stuff, Sean says.","Advertisement","Heres a gallery featuring more photos from the shoot:","And heres a look behind the scenes from the weekends shooting:","Share This Story","More cosplay showcase features:","When AnOverwatch Voice Actor Cosplays As Her Character","World Of WarCraft Cosplayers Are Out Here Re-Writing Canon","League Of Legends' K-Pop Video Already Has Amazing Cosplay","Check Out This FantasticFallout Cosplay","If Sailor Moon Was Goth","Sailor Moon Cosplay Is The Height Of 90s Fashion","About the author","Luke Plunkett is a Senior Editor based in Canberra, Australia.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Thursday welcomed Beto O'Rourke's announcement that he has officially launched his run for president.","\"As far as I'm concerned, the more the merrier,\" Harris, who launched her presidential campaign in January, said on MSNBC. There is an \"embarrassment of riches\" among the Democrats who are running for president, she added when asked about O'Rourke's candidacy.","Yet she also appeared to take a subtle dig at O'Rourke, a former three-term congressman who hasn't fully fleshed out his policy proposals for the presidential race.","The California senator, who was elected to the Senate in 2016, stressed that voters will be focused on whichever candidate has a \"proven record of producing\" results.","\"I think that there is no question, everybody in our country has a lot at stake in the outcome of this race,\" Harris said. \"People care about the issues that wake them up in the middle of the night, and they want to know that we have a plan for it.\"","She used the airtime to then lay out her middle-class tax plan. Last year, Harris introduced her $500-a-month proposal, which would grant $6,000 a year to families earning less than $100,000 a year, and $3,000 annually to individuals earning less than $50,000.","The grants would come in the form of tax breaks. However, the nonpartisan think tank Tax Policy Center says it is unsure how Harris would pay for the tax credits, as her current proposals would come up short.","Harris has also supported Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" proposal and is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.","O'Rourke has so far emphasized a hopeful message and his personal story rather than hard policy proposals. He has tended to seek more middle ground on issues, while the Democratic 2020 field has been leaning increasingly toward the left.","On Thursday morning, though, he said that he hasn't \"seen anything better\" to deal with climate change than the Green New Deal.","O'Rourke, a Texas Democrat who made headlines and became a social media sensation last year when he narrowly lost his Senate race to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, declared he was running for president Thursday morning. The former congressman raised more than $80 million in donations for his Senate campaign.","According to a Monmouth University poll, Harris is trailing fellow candidates Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in the Democratic primary. The three senators fall behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who has hinted at a presidential run, in the poll.","O'Rourke is No. 6 in the poll, following Sen.

Toby Alderweireld (Tottenham)","Alderweireld endured a difficult time at Spurs whilea contract dispute led tohis awkwardbenching. Yet the Belgium international came backwithan excellent World Cup as his country finished third in Russia, and hesoon returned to Mauricio Pochettino'sfirst team despite being heavily linked with a move to Manchester United in the summer. An extension to his contract was triggered, but that only means he can leave for a cut-price fee this summer.","Alderweireld is rarely caught out of position and is equally comfortable playing in a back three or back four. Hes a terrific passer too, and is particularly adept at spraying long diagonals out to the flanks.","9. Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham)","Now into his seventh season as a Tottenham player, Vertonghen has developed into one of the worlds leading centre-backs  and arguably the foremost in the Premier League  over the last couple of years.","Alderweireld's team-mate for club and countryis aggressive and an expert at wrestling the ball away from opposition strikers high upfield. He's strong in one-on-one duels and comfortable when forced to defend in wide areas and the Belgian is also surprisingly adept at left-back, where he put in a stunning display against Borussia Dortmund earlier this season.","8. Giorgio Chiellini (Juventus)","The grizzled Italian stalwart may have turned 34 in August, but he remains one of the standout players in his position. Strong in the tackle and commanding aerially, Chiellini is a wonderful reader of the game and an underrated passer from deep.","Juve's defensive stalwart is still a mainstay in theBianconeribackline and will be integral as they look to land a Champions League win for the first time since 1996.","7. Samuel Umtiti (Barcelona)","Little was known of Umtiti outside his native France before summer 2016, but it didnt take long for the centre-back to become a household name. Confirmation of his move from Lyon to Barcelona came midway through that years European Championship, when the defender turned in a flawless display on his international debut against Iceland in the quarter-finals.","Umtiti isnt the biggest at 6ft tall, but he more than makes up for his lack of height in other areas. Mobile, powerful and quick to anticipate danger, hes also a good passer and ball-carrier from the heart of the backline. He was a key member of the France side that triumphed to win the World Cup in Russia.","6. Diego Godin (Atletico Madrid)","Godin probably isnt the type of centre-half who would thrive under Pep Guardiola or Maurizio Sarri, but hes the perfect fit for Atletico Madrid and Uruguay. While hes by no means poor in possession  the 32-year-old has shownthat hes perfectly capable of carrying the ball upfield when the situation demands  Godin is more of an old-fashioned defender than most of his peers on this list.","Gritty, rugged and aggressive, the former Villarreal stopper is invariably in the right places at the right times. Blessed with great powers of anticipation, he also has a useful knack for popping up with vital set-piece goals.","Pages","Related Stories","FourFourTwos Best 100 Football Players in the World 2016: 40-31","The 11 best defenders in the world","Van Dijk: Ramos is not my type of defender","Resurgent Ajax planned triumphant return for Spurs pair in summer rebuild","Most Popular","Quiz!

The Chile forward has scored just two goals this season and struggled for playing time under interim boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.","His 500,000-a-week wages mean he will be hard to shift, but reports in Italy say Juventus would be prepared to take a chance on Sanchez if he takes a pay cut.","With United understood to be prioritising a winger in the summer transfer window, any potential arrival would push the 30-year-old further down the pecking order.","Fred (Manchester United)","Fred was being eyed by Premier League champions Manchester City before joining United last summer  and based on this seasons performances  its hard to see why.","Nemanja Matic, Ander Herrera, Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay have been used ahead of the 52million man by Solskjaer. With four years left on his contract, a loan move away could be the most realistic option for the Brazilian.","Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)","Even though he has been forcing his way back into Unai Emerys side in recent weeks, Ozils Arsenal future remains uncertain.","His form and availability have significantly dropped since signing a new 350,000-a-week deal last year.","And reports claim Emery is prepared to move Ozil on to free up funds for incoming transfers this summer. It could also allow Ozil to reignite his career elsewhere.","Mohamed Elneny (Arsenal)","Elneny has made just four Premier League appearances under Emery this season and did not even make the matchday squad for both legs of their Europa League last-16 triumph over Rennes earlier this month.","One of Arsene Wengers last acts as Arsenal manager was to hand Elneny a new contract until 2022, but the Egypt midfielder might need to reconsider his future this summer.","Divock Origi (Liverpool)","Despite deputising for the injured Roberto Firmino against Watford and Everton recently, Origi is unlikely to ever nail down a regular starting place under Jurgen Klopp.","Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane have restricted Origis playing time this season.","A summer move, maybe to a mid-table Premier League club, would do him the world of good.","Simon Mignolet (Liverpool)","Liverpools third-round exits in both domestic cup competitions have seen Mignolet play just twice for the club this season.","Alisson has featured in every minute of Liverpools 31 Premier League games since signing in a 67million deal from Roma last summer.","And his impressive form could force Mignolet to end his six-year affiliation with the Reds.","Vincent Janssen (Tottenham)","Janssens Tottenham days are clearly numbered. He is yet to make a single appearance for Mauricio Pochettinos side this season and his only playing time since his return from injury has come with the Under-23s team.","He was linked with moves to Crystal Palace and Cardiff in the January transfer window, but a move abroad seems the most likely option when the transfer window reopens.","Victor Wanyama (Tottenham)","After featuring heavily in his 2016/17 debut season with Tottenham, various injuries have affected his first-team chances.","The Kenya midfielder has started just two league games this term and is behind Harry Winks, Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko in the pecking order.","If Wanyama was to leave Spurs, he would not be short of suitors.","Danny Drinkwater (Chelsea)","It is hard to believe that Drinkwater, a Premier League title winner with Leicester only three seasons ago, has not played a second of competitive football in the 2018/19 campaign.","Bought for 35million in 2017, the 29-year-old has been an expensive flop.","Despite his lack of game-time, Drinkwater does not seem to be in any hurry to push for a move.","In December, when asked about the England midfielders future, Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri said: I dont know. It depends on the club, its up to him.","Ethan Ampadu (Chelsea)","Chelseas two-window transfer ban could affect what they do with their young players next season.","Renowned for sending their young stars on loan across the country, Ampadu could do with a temporary move away from Stamford Bridge.","At the age of 18, he has won six caps for Wales and is highly-rated by Dragons boss Ryan Giggs.","Claudio Bravo (Manchester City)","Manchester Citys No.2 goalkeeper Bravo was on the bench for the clubs first two games of the season before suffering a serious achilles tendon injury.","In his absence, 20-year-old stopper Arijanet Muric impressed in Citys run to the Carabao Cup final, including two penalty shootout saves in their quarter-final win over Leicester.","Murics form could see Pep Guardiola part ways with Bravo, who has just one year left on his contract.","Phil Foden (Manchester City)","This would only be a loan move after the youngster signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal in December. Citys array of talent in midfield has seen the 18-year-old start just seven times this season.","A full season, playing regular football would be hugely beneficial to the England Under-21 international.","FOLLOW talkSPORT","Services"],"targetCaptions":[]}

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. For an explanation of our Advertising Policy, visit this page.","With the recent frenzy of warnings from the US Department of Health about potential measles exposure in airports across the US, you might be wondering if its time to check up on your immunizations.","Last week, it was Los Angeles International (LAX), and three weeks ago it was Chicago Midway (MDW). Early this week, Newark Liberty (EWR) saw its second alert in four months. In 2019 alone, there have been about 270 cases of measles reported in 15 states but might not be as scary as they seem.","As it turns out, its not uncommon for infectious diseases to pop up in airports. They are the ultimate travel hubs. But its the appearance of measles  an infectious disease that was once considered eliminated in the US  that has disturbing implications.","Dr. Manisha Patel, team leader for measles epidemiology at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), confirmed in an interview with TPG that more measles cases were reported in 2018 and 2019 than in years past. The most recent large outbreak occurred in Disneyland in 2014. In fact, about two-thirds of the recent cases in the US come from unvaccinated travelers who contract the disease when they travel abroad and bring it back home.","I think what people should be concerned about is that there is a disease thats been eliminated in the US, [but] its not eliminated in most other countries, Patel said. And its not just a minor bug. There are deaths associated with measles, there are complications associated with measles, Patel explained.","Measles is everywhere  its in Europe, its in South America, Patel said. You can get measles anywhere. Measles in airports certainly is always a concern because you can contract measles within two hours of an infected person leaving that area. That virus is still circulating in that vicinity  so if an unvaccinated person walks through a terminal an hour and a half after someone with measles was just there, they can get it, she added.","While measles is considered to be the most contagious infectious disease worldwide, its also one of the most preventable.","Measles vaccine, with one dose, is 93% effective  so that means if you have 100 people in a room and theyre all vaccinated, 93 of them wont get measles. And with two doses, its 97%, Patel explained.","The MMR vaccine also offers a lifetime of immunity to mumps and rubella, in addition to the measles. Children should get the MMR vaccine between 6 and 12 months old, and everyone else should get the vaccine before they travel. Two doses (97% effective immunization) is recommended.","The US does not have a vaccine supply issue for MMR. Its readily available in many clinics and travel clinics. Its not expensive. There should be no barrier to getting MMR in the US, which is why we encourage travelers or anybody traveling abroad to get vaccinated before they go, Patel said.","A majority of people born in the US since 1995 have been vaccinated for measles, according to annual studies conducted by the CDC. So, as long as youve been vaccinated, your chances of contracting the illness are pretty slim  even if youre in an airport.","When [measles] lands in an area  what I mean by landing in an area is that you take a person with measles and drop them in a geographic location where you have good vaccine coverage  it stays  limited, Patel said. You dont have a lot of spread. But, if you allow that same case to drop in an area where coverage is lower, and that could be for various reasons, not just philosophical, you will get spread, she added.","The MMR vaccine is safe and highly effective, Patel said. As a preventative measure, Patel recommends getting the MMR vaccine even after exposure.","Patel also suggests that if you plan on traveling, and you only think you have been vaccinated, its best to dig a little deeper. Try and locate your immunization record as confirmation of vaccination, instead of trying to recall from memory, Patel suggested. If you cannot find proof of immunity, or were born after 1957, you should consider getting MMR vaccine before traveling in accordance with CDC Yellow Book recommendations, he said.","The CDC Yellow Book is a great resource for travelers who plan to travel outside of the country. Concerned travelers can pick their destination and view which vaccines and medications they need prior to their trip. A recommendation that travelers vaccinate against measles, mumps and rubella recently was added to the Yellow Book.","Featured image by Media for Medical/UIG via Getty Images.","Share this:","News and deals straight to your inbox every day.","SIGN-UP BONUS: 50,000 Miles","TPG'S BONUS VALUATION: $700","CARD HIGHLIGHTS: 10X miles on stays booked and paid for through Hotels.com/Venture + 2x miles on everything else.

Lord of the Rings too. But we thought, 22 movies in, wouldn't it be fun to bring some finality to the storyline?\"","While the term \"Infinity Saga\" has been used colloquially by some fans, Feige's alleged comments suggest that it could be a new official umbrella term for the first decade of Marvel Studios productions.","Previously, Marvel Studios had linked its films under three separate phases, with corresponding box sets for home video releases. Phase 1 consisted of Iron Man through 2012's The Avengers, Phase 2 consisted of Iron Man 3 through Ant-Man and Phase 3 included Captain America: Civil War through Avengers: Endgame. What Marvel Studios intends to refer to films released after Endgame including the upcoming Spider-Man: Far From Home and in-development Black Widow solo film is currently unknown.","RELATED:Avengers: Endgame Almost Had No Marketing at All","Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Avengers: Endgame stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau and Bradley Cooper, with Gwyneth Paltrow and Josh Brolin.

He says this is the first time their role faking documents has been exposed.","The team was funded by the so-called \"secret vote\" - where government money not subject to parliamentary scrutiny was used.","Part of the project involved working abroad, but it also fed information to London-based academics and correspondents.","Among the newly released files are lists of trusted journalists.","In 1960 that included Neal Ascherson - then a young reporter at the Observer newspaper who was introduced to the IRD by Edward Crankshaw, a more senior Soviet specialist.","\"I was taken to a London club and we had a nice lunch with Edward and myself and this gentleman,\" Mr Ascherson remembered.","\"After I'd been looked over and tested... I was allowed to receive the news bulletin of eastern European 'product'.\"","The IRD information was delivered by hand and treated as secret - but Mr Ascherson said he \"very rapidly discovered it was completely useless\", since it contained \"stale, out of date\" news.","He found the analysis \"childish very cold warrior\", and says he never relied on the information.","Faked notepaper","According to Mr Lashmar, the officials at the IRD were enjoying the game, competing with the other side.","One complex scheme involved faking a press release from the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFYD), a Communist-backed organisation based in Budapest.","In 1963, African students in Bulgaria made international news. Scores had left the country, claiming racial discrimination, and the IRD decided to use this to \"intensify indignation... against Bloc countries\".","On fake headed notepaper, the IRD circulated a press release to hundreds of newspapers and opinion formers - sending the releases via the British diplomatic bag which meant they would have the right postmark.","The press release - reprinted in full by a news agency in Zanzibar - included an offensive statement that the Africans \"emerging from the jungle darkness of want, [they] were not equipped to understand that food, fuel and clothes were not freely attainable...\"","African students were furious. The Nigerian student union said this was a declaration of \"white superiority\".","Some weeks later, the WFYD insisted it had been a fake release.","'Trotskyists' in Islington North","Most of the IRD's efforts were concentrated on foreign news, but occasionally they were employed in the UK.","In 1962 Labour MP for Islington North, Gerry Reynolds, asked for their help.","He feared his local Labour party was being taken over by \"a well-organised group of extreme left-wing malcontents, probably Trotskyists\", and wanted the IRD to dig up any information on the individuals concerned.","The IRD turned to the security services, which confirmed that Dorothy Hayward had been a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1947; that Sidney Lubin had endorsed a Communist council candidate in 1951; and that Francis Dunne had distributed a Trotskyite newsletter.","This information was \"a bit stingy\", wrote one IRD officer whose disappointment suggested he had expected more information. Nonetheless, he passed it on to Mr Reynolds, who remained the MP there until 1969.","It is not known what - if anything - happened to those people the IRD had named.","Faked posters","The files show the IRD manufactured and distributed statements from the International Institute for Peace in Vienna on several occasions.","It also faked posters from the International Union of Students, replacing the acronym \"US\" with Chinese characters, to turn an anti-US nuclear campaign into an anti-Chinese one.","This is the first time that IRD's own forgeries have been revealed.","At the time, it was keen to highlight forged documents produced by the Communists. They were known to be prolific: at one point a forged British cabinet paper was being circulated amongst African leaders.","In North Korea and East Germany, such fakes were produced on an industrial scale, according to files recently released.","Mr Lashmar said: \"Should a democracy be secretly putting out fake or forged material? No. If totalitarian people are manipulating things that doesn't mean we should follow suit.\"","Related Topics","Share this story        Aboutsharing","More on this story","Top Stories","The chancellor believes an agreement can be reached with Labour despite no talks planned this weekend.","Features","The NFL star abandoned on London's streets","Unforgettable TV - Our Planet, Attenboroughs Netflix debut","The treasure hunt that gripped a nation","How did the Kardashians make their millions?","The women divided by Brexit","Israel election: Who are the key candidates?","The 'womanspreading' placard that caused fury in Pakistan","Secrets of Race Across the World","How Algeria's army sacrificed a president to keep power","Elsewhere on the BBC","Legendary live gigs","Five life-changing concerts from the music world","Daily news briefing direct to your inbox","Sign up for our newsletter","BBC News Navigation","BBC News Services","Explore the BBC"],"targetCaptions":[]}

It's the only place - other than Skirmish - to fight other players in a PvP environment, and it's also where you'll get some of the best loot available in the game. You need to progress quite a way through The Division 2 before you can access the Dark Zone though, so if you're wondering how to unlock the Dark Zone in The Division 2, read on.","Division 2 tips | Best Division 2 skills | Best Division 2 perks | Division 2 Hyena Key locations | Division 2 Dark Zone Keys | How to level up fast in The Division 2 | Division 2 masks | Division 2 Ivory Keys | Division 2 Dark Zone guide | How to unlock the Dark Zone in The Division 2 | Division 2 crafting guide | Division 2 specializations | How to unlock specializations in The Division 2 | Division 2 dyes | Division 2 mods | Division 2 map | Division 2 printer filament | Division 2 bounties | Division 2 builds | Division 2 Snitch Cards | Division 2 hidden side missions | Division 2 Exotics | Division 2 endgame","How to unlock the Dark Zone in The Division 2","So youve jumped into The Division 2 headfirst and you cant wait to test your mettle against other players. Just go to the Dark Zone! Unfortunately, its not quite that simple. You first need to ensure youve unlocked the Theater settlement in Downtown East - this is the first settlement you unlock, still during the initial stages of the game.","When youve completed that and met with Odessa Sawyer multiple times, youll be able to complete the various projects available at the Theater. You cant gain access to the Dark Zone until youve recruited the right person; Senait Ezera. Shes the third person you can recruit back to the Base of Operations from the Theater, so youre going to need to upgrade the Theater three times. This is done by completing the available projects, which require donations and activities to be completed.","When you recruit Inaya al-Khaliq and Grace Larson, youll be able to unlock Senait Ezera. She took a while to show up for us so if she should be available but isnt, leave and complete a mission or two then return; you should find her on ground level, at the end of the alley past the loading docks. Talk to her and shell enable the Dark Zone East Recon mission.","From here, its as simple as going to the mission location and doing everything she tells you. Its essentially a brief tutorial to the Dark Zone and isnt particularly difficult, so youll fly through it. After that, youll be able to go and complete the Recon missions for Dark Zone South and Dark Zone West.

Hayner | @ChrisHayner on March 29, 2019 at 7:21AM PDT","The golden age of Saturday morning cartoons is an era that will always live on in our memories. After all, who didn't sit down with a bowl of cereal to follow the newest adventures of GI Joe, Transformers, or any number of other series to kick off their weekend as kids?","Here's something you might not have realized, though. As it turns out, way too many of those amazing cartoons were created as nothing more than marketing tools for toys. Some of the shows made perfect sense, as action-based toy lines left plenty of room for stories to be told. Others, however, had to reach pretty far to work a storyline into what was otherwise a pretty basic and story-free line of toys.","Take a look at our favorite toy-based cartoons below, then sound off with the ones you loved in the comments. And when you're done, make sure to check out our look at cartoons based movies. You might be surprised at some of the very adult movies that got a kid-friendly adaptation.","Share this Gallery","Latest Image Galleries","Avengers Endgame: 10 Things We Learned From Watching 10 Minutes Of Exclusive Footage","Apex Legends Guide: 12 Tips For Winning Gun Fights And Be A Better Teammate","Avengers Endgame New Trailer Breakdown: Cap And Tony Reunite And Everything Else","1. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe","He-Man's cartoon is an interesting one because the toy it's based on was made simply to try to cash in on the Star Wars craze. One part space warrior and another part Conan the Barbarian, He-Man got comics before he became a cartoon, but once the franchise was animated, it became wildly popular and even spawned the She-Ra spin-off and a Christmas special.","2. Hot Wheels","Everyone knows the most exciting thing about the Hot Wheels toy line was the people driving the cars, right? Nope. The animated series, which only managed to squeak out 17 episodes, followed a high school student that started his own racing club. It was bad, but it's also one of the first toy-based cartoons. Hot Wheels premiered in 1969 and had complaints lodged against it with the FCC that it was nothing more than a half-hour commercial, which it was.","3. Pound Puppies","Pound Puppies were the saving grace of kids who didn't have actual dogs. The toy line was simple, it was a bunch of stuffed dogs that kids would \"adopt.\" The show, which ran for two seasons between 1986 and 1987, gave a bunch of the dogs personalities and somehow makes the dog pound seem like a cool place for animals.","4. Jem","It's rock and roll Barbie, which is kind of a perfect toy idea. It was only a matter of time before it got turned into a cartoon, which is when the Jem franchise caught fire in a truly outrageous way---truly, truly, truly outrageous. The Jem cartoon ran for three seasons in the '80s, and a 2017 live-action movie was even released, though it was met with bad reviews and a short, disastrous box office run.","5. Mighty Max","The Mighty Max line of toys itself was a spin-off of Polly Pocket. Each variation was a tiny pocket-sized playset that would put the titular character in all kinds of danger. The cartoon, however, features the aforementioned Mighty Max as a kid with a magical baseball cap that allows him to teleport through space and time as he fights against the Skullmaster, an ancient evil being. It's a pretty wild concept, even for a cartoon from 1993, and it lasted 40 episodes.","6. Captain N: The Game Masters","The Nintendo Entertainment System counts as a toy, right? Of course it does! Captain N was the coolest and convinced many of us that carrying around a Zapper from the NES in a holster was perfectly normal. The series featured characters from a number of Nintendo games, including Castlevania, Mega Man, Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda. If that's not exciting for you, I'm not sure what to say.","7. Sky Commanders","Sky Commanders was a very cool toy that led to a less-than-cool cartoon. The toy was essentially an action figure that traveled across strings you'd hang up throughout your bedroom. It was messy, but so much fun. The animated series saw ongoing battles between good and evil mountaineers facing off on a new continent. Like many cartoons of the era, it was a lot of gibberish. However, it took a relatively simple and very fun toy idea and made it simply too complex.","8. The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin","What's strange about this particular animated series is that Teddy Ruxpin was essentially an animatronic tape player. There wasn't a lot of playing to be done with this toy. Instead, you watched its mouth move while a cassette played. The cartoon, however, is a lot more intense. Teddy and his friend--an octopede named Grubby--leave their home in search of treasure before coming up against an evil group known as the Monsters and Villains Organization--in case you were wondering if they should be trusted--also searching for a magical treasure they want to use to rule the world. Teddy, sadly, was not powered by cassette tapes in this wildly convoluted show.","9. GI Joe: The Real American Hero","GI Joe is, perhaps, the second most successful cartoon adaptation of a toy. The line of soldier toys have spawned six animated series, two movies, comic books, and continue to be a household name to this day. What's more, all of that is possible due to the original 1985 cartoon, which helped to drive the toy's popularity.","10. Care Bears","If you were a child of the '80s, chances are you spent some time trying to perfect the Care Bear Stare. What's interesting about the Care Bears, though, is that while the cartoon--and movies that followed--were based on the popular plush toys from the early '80s, the entire franchise actually started as a line of greeting cards.","11. Creepy Crawlers","It's a cartoon based on a toy that's sort of like an Easy Bake Oven, but for rubber bugs you should never eat. If you had a Creepy Crawlers toy, chances are you made gross-looking bugs for about a week then lost interest because it does literally nothing else. However, the cartoon actually got 23 episodes and was about a kid who wanted to be a magician that created creepy bug-like mutant creatures. Oddly enough, the animated series got its own line of action figures. Thus, they were toys based on a cartoon based on a toy.","12. Dino-Riders","Dino-Riders is the perfect concept of both an '80s action toy and an exciting Saturday morning cartoon. Two warring alien races crash on Earth during prehistoric times and equip dinosaurs with all manner of weaponry to continue their battle. The possibilities for toy varieties were endless and the animated series--which somehow only lasted 14 episodes--was fantastic.","13. Dungeons & Dragons","Turning an RPG game like Dungeons & Dragons into an animated series seems like an easy choice. Simply adapt one of the games stories for kids. Instead, the D&D cartoon is about a group of kids that get sucked into the world of the game after taking a ride on a magical rollercoaster. They then spend the rest of the series trying to get home, you know, because they're children stuck in a horrifying world. And, of course, the series ended before they actually had the chance to escape. So, in theory, they all probably died stuck in whatever realm they landed in.","14. Challenge of the GoBots","GoBots! They're like Transformers but way less exciting. Honestly, the two toy lines are so alike, down to them being warring factions from a distant fictional planet. However, while GoBots lasted an impressive 65 episodes, it was always seen as the second-rate Transformers knockoff. Of course, that's until Hasbro bought the property and incorporated it into the Transformers canon.","15. My Little Pony","This might come as a surprise but the My Little Pony animated series and theatrical movie didn't debut until 1986, four years after the launch of the toyline. Prior to that, there were two syndicated half-hour specials set in the world of the toy.","16. M.A.S.K.","M.A.S.K.--short for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand--was a weird mix of GI Joe and Transformers. But if you're going to copy two things, copy two of the best! The toys and animated series featured an elite task force drove special vehicles that transformed into battle tanks, fighter jets, and the like to fight against an enemy called V.E.N.O.M., which totally isn't a riff on GI Joe's Cobra at all.","17. Ring Raiders","Do you even remember Ring Raiders? They were essentially the Micro Machines version of airplanes, mounted to plastic rings, and they were awesome. As much fun as the toys were, though, the cartoon is a bit baffling. It was, naturally, about a group of special fighter pilots. To work the rings into the lore, though, each pilot wore one that could call the fellow Ring Raiders. It lasted five episodes.","18. Popples","Honestly, Popples more-or-less looked like neon teddy bears. In the series, several of them were given personalities and a human family they lived with. Unlike many cartoons of the time, the Popples series wasn't about going to mystic lands or searching for treasure. Instead, the kids simply tried to keep their parents from finding out the Popples were real. The series was able to sustain that for 41 episodes--plus three more that never aired.","19. Street Sharks","The '80s and '90s were a strange time where mutant animal warriors reigned supreme. Whether it was the Ninja Turtles, Biker Mice from Mars, or Street Sharks, somewhere there was a normal animal turned into a human-like beast out there defeating evil. Of those three, though, Street Sharks was the only one that was a toy first.","It gave the bizarre toys an even more bizarre backstory about an evil scientist genetically modifying four brothers to turn them into humanoid sharks. From there, the brothers attempt to stop him from doing further heinous deeds, while also doing battle against a wide range of even creepier creations he's come up with, like a mutant lobster with the DNA of Genghis Khan for some reason. Street Sharks is super weird.","20. Transformers","It's hard to argue that Transformers is the king of this particular mountain. The vehicles that transform into robot warriors were all the rage in the '80s and the animated series that launched in 1984 spun off into a long list of cartoons, animated movies and, now, six live-action films.

The tweets, which touched on pedophilia and rape, were cited by Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn as \"indefensible and inconsistent\" with Disney's values, and ultimately led to his decision to fire Gunn from the franchise. In the almost year since then, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has been put on the back-burner, with Gunn's next move to sign on to helm The Suicide Squad for Warner Bros. and DC.","Following his firing, Warner Bros. made it very clear that the studio did not have a problem with bringing Gunn on board for a potential project despite his resurfaced tweets. It wasn't entirely surprising, then, when Gunn was hired to pen a sequel to Suicide Squad, an announcement made with the caveat of there being potential for him to direct the film as well, a development that followed shortly thereafter.","Obviously, Disney's decision to bring Gunn back into the Marvel Studios fold is good for the director on a personal level, and for the studio considering fan reaction to his firing in the first place. But how does Gunn's return to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 affect The Suicide Squad in a positive way?","It's pretty simple; Disney's decision to rehire Gunn for Vol. 3 helps to remove any gray cloud that might have hung over his work on The Suicide Squad.","RELATED: James Gunn Will Direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 After All","When Disney initially fired Gunn, the studio's decision was met with plenty of backlash, despite Gunn's acceptance of it all. Fans -- and fellow creatives -- were outraged that a studio would fire someone that had worked for them on multiple films, simply because an alt-right journalist had unearthed decade old tweets and reframed them out of context. To complicate matters further, in trying to figure out who could possibly replace Gunn it became clear that the only option -- at least, for fans -- was Gunn, as unlikely as it might have seemed. In fact, as time went on, and it became clear the studio had yet to secure a new director, Gunn's fellow Marvel creatives -- including Thor: Ragnarok director, Taika Waititi -- threw their support behind Gunn.","Still, in recent months, it seemed as though Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 had become a low priority for the studio, with the film still unscheduled and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige continuing to stress it'll happen despite being unable to promise when it would actually come to be. Unlike Ant-Man and Thor: The Dark World, which had their own director issues after Edgar Wright and Patty Jenkins left those films, Guardians pre-production came to a halt almost immediately after Gunn was fired, and no replacements were ever officially in contention. It ended up casting a pall over the project, suggesting it may actually not happen at all -- especially as Gunn seemingly moved on with Marvel's biggest competitor -- Warner Bros. and DC.","RELATED: Gunn's GotG Return Signals That Disney Has Learned 'Don't Listen to Trolls'","Ironically, though, Gunn's return to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a blessing for both Marvel Studios and DC Films. Not only does Marvel get to bring Gunn back into the fold and allow him to complete his trilogy, the studio gets to right a major wrong it made nearly a year ago. But perhaps, more importantly, Gunn's reinstatement as director on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has the biggest positive effect on The Suicide Squad. While many have been excited to see what Gunn will do with that property, especially as its being hailed a soft reboot following the poorly received first film, there was still something of a dark cloud hanging over Gunn's hiring on that project, despite the studio fully throwing its support behind the director.","Despite Gunn having moved on, the focus was still on Guardians and Disney. While many were eager to see Gunn back on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, feeling as though Disney's initial reaction was rash and not thought out, there was still a vocal group that was in support of Horn's decision to cut ties with the director. Even as time went on, the controversy never fully died down, especially as other directors continued to openly talk about Gunn's firing online. On one hand, keeping the conversation going probably helped to led to Gunn's reinstatement. But on the other hand, had he not been re-hired, keeping the conversation going would have resulted in it being a continued topic even as Gunn moved on to direct The Suicide Squad for Warner Bros. and DC, and that wouldn't have been fair for that project.","RELATED: Gunn's Suicide Squad Will Be a Relaunch, with a Mostly All-New Cast","But now that he's confirmed to direct both -- with The Suicide Squad set to come first -- it's safe to say Warner Bros. is the bigger winner of the two. Sure, Marvel gets Gunn back to complete the trilogy he envisioned, but Warner Bros. gets to see Gunn make his true comeback with The Suicide Squad, which he'll begin production on later this year, before moving on to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 sometime next year, and he'll make that comeback after having been vindicated by his original employer, not while he's still fighting for it.","Gunn is confirmed to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and The Suicide Squad, with the latter expected to go into production first for a potential 2021 release.","Tags:\njames gunn,\nfeature,\nguardians of the galaxy vol. 3","Leave A Comment","More in CBR Exclusives","WonderCon LIVE: The Cast of Archer Rockets Us To Archer: 1999","Seriously, Why Is Zac Efron Rumored For So Many Superhero Roles?","Marvel Rising: Heart of Iron Premieres at WonderCon LIVE","Teen Titans: Was Jericho Always Gay?

How is Finland so happy?","targetDescription":"Credit the saunas and berries","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["Credit the saunas and berries","March 20, 20193:15 PM EDT","For the second year in a row, Finland grabbed the top spot as the happiest country in the world with its Nordic buddies close behind: Denmark was second, Norway third and Iceland fourth.","Canada? We werent too far behind the hygge-championing nations that focus on cozy living. We are the ninth happiest country in the world, says the UN World Happiness Report released Wednesday.","The report ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be, according to their own evaluations of their lives.","Despite frigid winters that reach extremes of -50 C, a suicide rate (16.4 per 100,000) that exceeds the OECD average and falling birth rates (1.6 births per woman)  endorphins are coursing through the Finns.","But it might not be so surprising for a country that experiences 200 days of winter in the north.","The Finnish culture obviously contributes to their happiness.","Theres nothing quite like getting naked and steamy in a sauna with a fellow Finn. It is a must at regular intervals, Finlands tourism site exhorts, and if they go too long without sauna, theyll start feeling incomplete.","Finlands access to exceptional nature also contributes to their overall happiness. Apparently, Finns will grab a berry-picking basket to take with them on strolls through the woods.","The Nordic nations education system differs from how we think of schooling in North America. Instead of starting school in Grade 1 at the age of six, Finnish children start basic education at age seven. On top of that, they attend basic education until theyre 16. Then, theres a Finnish form of high school from 16 to 19.","Formal testing isnt pushed upon the students until theyre into their mid-teens. Instead, teachers have much control over how and what they teach, including the selection of textbooks they assign. Younger pupils are barely given homework, but are pushed to find their passions and encouraged to learn through play, the New York Times reported.","Finlands Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) score averages 523  the average for OECD countries is 486.","The efficacy of Finlands education system means that 88 per cent of the populace has a post-secondary education and 69 per cent has paid jobs. By comparison, the OECD average is 74 per cent and 67 per cent respectively.","Finns also take community seriously. Ninety-five per cent of people in Finland said they know someone they could rely on in a time of need. Boosting community is the motivation for a growing trend in Finnish cities  reinvigorating their libraries.","In the city of Vantaa, the number of library visitors has increased by 14 per cent and people are spending more time there to hang out. The library has introduced new services to engage youth while also cutting costs. People report their time spent in libraries has increased by 300 per cent.","When Finland was deemed the happiest country in the world in 2018, Finnish philosopher Frank Martela posited that it was in part due to the Finns tendency to be humble.","In Finnish culture, he says, people arent overt about their achievements  especially blasting them on social media. People tend to downplay successes online and offline, which in turn makes Finns happier.","This is because social comparison seems to play a significant role in peoples life satisfaction, he wrote in Scientific American. If everybody else is doing better than you, it is hard to be satisfied with your life conditions, no matter how good they objectively are.","Among OECD countries, Finland ranks sixth in terms of a clean environment while Canada ranks eighth.","The quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being, it says on the OECDs website.

Kartan also was found guilty of fraud in foreign labor contracting.","These defendants exploited one victim after another, using them to labor in their home, failing to pay wages and depriving them of basic human rights, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott said in the release.","Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month","Get full access to The Sacramento Bee content across all your devices.","From February 2014 through October 2016, Kartan and Barai hired people from overseas to do domestic work in their Stockton home.","Federal prosecutors said the couple made false claims about wages and work duties in advertisements seeking workers online and in India-based newspapers.","After the workers arrived in Stockton, Kartan and Barai forced them to work 18 hours a day while depriving them of sleep and food, according to the prosecutors. They said few of the workers were paid a wage.","The defendants kept the workers from leaving their jobs by threatening them, by creating an atmosphere of fear, control and disempowerment, according to the release. Several workers also were threatened that attempts to leave their jobs would be reported to police or immigration officials.","Sean Ragan, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI Field Office, said Kartan and Barai did more than simply fail to pay victims for their work.","They deprived (the workers) of their dignity and robbed them of their federally protected civil rights, Ragan said in the release.","Some of the workers who said they were victimized by the couple flew from India and Nepal to testify in the trial.","The abuse became worse when a worker pushed back or wanted to leave. The prosecutors said the couple at times hit or burned the workers.","The defendants hit one worker on multiple occasions, according to prosecutors. Testimony in the trial indicated that Barai backhanded the worker across her face for talking back, and slammed her hands down on a gas stove, which resulted in first- and second-degree burns on her hands. The prosecutors said Barai also threatened to kill the worker and throw her bones in the garbage.","Kartan and Barai are scheduled to be sentenced June 6. The maximum sentence they each face also includes a potential $250,000 fine.","Human trafficking is a disgraceful and unacceptable crime, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division said in the release.

A lot of people are supporting him, especially me and my family, my children are big fans of him.","We were here for the last (Champions League group) game against Napoli and they met Virgil.","I think theyve done a great job so far but everyone knows that its starting now: the last seven games to play in the Premier League and the challenge they have in the Champions League.

Players who are coming in, players who are not playing every game, once they come in, they can make a difference.","The season will be decided by very small details. I dont think I have to tell that to the players or to the coaching staff because they all have great experience and they know what its all about.","All I can say is that I wish them all the best and great luck and I will support them from Holland.","Im very excited and Im looking forward to the next couple of months for Liverpool.

I think it can be an advantage for them because the players look in great shape. At the end of the season the strength and the energy you will lose a little bit, but so far they are looking really sharp.","As the stakes keep getting higher, Kuyt doesn't fear the prospect of nerves denting Liverpool's charge.","\"The pressure is always high in football, especially at Liverpool Football Club,\" he said.","\"But if you see the team and the way they have coped with pressure so far, they score goals when they have to score goals.","\"For example, a few months ago there was the last-minute goal against Everton,or the last game against Fulham when it went to 1-1, it was not easy to turn that game into a 2-1 win, and thats when you can see that a team can handle pressure.

Now it seems that eco-labelling schemes could be a possible fix to avoid fakes.","A study by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) has found that less than 1 per cent of seafood bearing its sustainability mark was mislabelled. This was determined using DNA tests on 1402 products sold in 18 countries between 2009 and 2016.","Advertisement","Read more: Astronauts could use fish and human waste to grow food on long trips","Consumers are often in the dark over where their fish comes from, which can have serious health and sustainability implications. Egregious examples can include toxic pufferfish sold as monkfish and the meat of endangered whales passed off as fatty tuna.","People know about it, the question is what do you do about it, says Jaco Barendse at the MSC.","All the wrongly labelled seafoods bearing the MSC logo were white fish, including cods and hakes, which can be easily mistaken for one another. Names on packaging such as snapper or skate, which cover up to 60 different species, also dont help.","Hoki or hake","The study found just two examples of deliberate mislabelling among fish bearing its logo, with hoki swapped for hake, and haddock for cod.","The motivation for misleading consumers is financial  cheaper fish passed off as more expensive ones. Deliberate mislabelling across all seafood is estimated to involve billions of pounds of sales globally.","That average 30 per cent [of all fish mislabelled] gives you no indication of whether it is deliberate or unintentional, says Francis Neat of the MSC. But there are ways to get at the truth. We can do the tracebacks [through the supply chain] and figure out where the substitution occurred, and whether it is for financial gain or not, he says.","Eco labels are just one way to avoid being duped. Education also helps. Few customers of fish and chip shops in the UK, for example, know that rock salmon, which is often on the menu, is another term for dogfish, which are overfished sharks.","People should know where their fish was caught, how and when, and what species it is. If you dont know those things, you cant make informed choices on whether you can eat a fish with a clear conscience, says Callum Roberts of the University of York, UK, who wasnt involved in the study.","He also points to the limits of DNA testing, which can tell species apart but not whether a fish comes from a sustainable stock.","Journal reference: Current Biology, DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.014","More on these topics:","Advertisement","Magazine issue\n                                    \n                                        3222\n                                    \n                                    , published 23 March 2019","Previous article","Our brains might sense Earth's magnetic field just like birds do","Next article","Boys and girls may have differing attitudes to risk thanks to society","Advertisement","Sign up to our newsletter","Get the app","FOLLOW US"],"targetCaptions":[]}

rated\nhttps://t.co/Vhhaui3AY7"],"postMedia":[],"targetTitle":"Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur players rated: The all-time list","targetDescription":"10 of stars to have turned out at both Anfield and White Hart Lane","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["10 of stars to have turned out at both Anfield and White Hart Lane","Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur are a couple of the most iconic names in English football and a significant number of players have turned out for both clubs.","While regional rivalries the Reds have with Manchester United  there has been no direct transfer between the clubs since Phil Chisnall back in 1964  or with neighbours Everton tend to prevent business, journeying between Anfield and White Hart Lane was a well-trodden path over the years.","Ahead of their crunch match this Sunday, here is a selection of 10 of the stars to have turned out for both with their Liverpool and Tottenham credentials rated.","Nick Barmby","Born: Hull, February 11, 1974","Despite hailing from Yorkshire, Barmby joined Tottenham straight from school and established himself as a regular while still just 18 years old.","He was part of manager Ossie Ardiles' swashbuckling five-man attack that also included Jurgen Klinsmann, Teddy Sheringham, Darren Anderton and Ilie Dumitrescu.","Barmby would go on to become the then record signing for both Middlesbrough and Everton before his controversial 6million move across Stanley Park in 2000 after an impressive final season at Goodison Park in which he'd got himself back into the England side.","He started impressively at Anfield, rubbing salt into the wounds of the Blues by netting in a Merseyside Derby victory and also scored a penalty in the shoot-out win over Birmingham City in the League Cup final  the first of three cup wins for Gerard Houllier's side that season.","However, injuries and a lack of form saw things go downhill fast in his second year and he was packed off to Leeds United for 2.75million in August 2002.","Liverpool rating: 6","Tottenham rating: 7","Read More","Ray Clemence","Born: Skegness, August 5, 1948","Plucked from Third Division Scunthorpe United by Bill Shankly while still a teenager, Clemence developed to become a goalkeeper who is regarded by many as being the best in Liverpool's history.","He picked up a treasure trove of five League Championships, FA Cup, League Cup, three European Cups and two UEFA Cups while with the Reds before departing in 1981.","Clemence went on to play on for another seven years at Tottenham, picking up another FA Cup and UEFA Cup although he was injured for the final of the latter.","Liverpool rating: 10","Tottenham rating: 9","Read More","Robbie Keane","Born: Dublin, July 8, 1980","Liverpool became the well-travelled striker's sixth club when he joined them from Tottenham for 19million in 2008.","He would declare that it was a dream move as he had been a boyhood fan of the Reds  only to churn out a similar mantra when joining Celtic in 2010.","A clever player known for his movement in the box, Keane had been a prolific scorer at White Hart Lane  breaking the 20-goal barrier in the last two of his six seasons  and was expected to add a new dimension to Rafael Benitez's attack.","The Spaniard seemed to conclude pretty quickly though that the player who would become the Republic of Ireland's record goalscorer wasn't suited to his side though and after just half a season in which he scored seven times in 28 outings, he was sold back to Tottenham at a significant loss.","Keane was less prolific second time around at White Hart Lane and would only truly rediscover his old scoring touch in his latter years in Major League Soccer for Los Angeles Galaxy where he was reunited with Steven Gerrard for a time.","Liverpool rating: 3","Tottenham rating: 8","Read More","Danny Murphy","Born: Chester, March 18, 1977","One of the once famous Crewe Alexandra conveyor belt of young talent, Murphy took his time to settle at Anfield after arriving as a 20-year-old and was loaned back to his former club but from 1999 onwards he started to establish himself as a classy presence in Liverpool's midfield.","He'd go on to establish himself as an England international, playing over 200 games for the Reds and as well as being part of their 2001 cup treble-winning squad, he holds a special place in Kopite folklore having scored the winning goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford on no fewer than three separate occasions.","He joined Spurs for 2million in January 2006 but unable to establish himself as a regular it was only after he moved across the capital to Fulham than he enjoyed a fruitful Indian Summer to his career.","Liverpool rating: 8","Tottenham rating: 4","Read More","Jamie Redknapp","Born: Barton on Sea, June 25, 1973","A Bournemouth wonderkid when his father, Harry was manager, a teenage Redknapp was one of the last signings of Kenny Dalglish's first spell in charge at Anfield when he arrived in February 1991.","Later that year he became Liverpool's youngest ever player to appear in European competition and he would go on to develop into one of the silkiest English midfielders around.","Making over 300 appearances for the Reds over the following decade, he would progress to become captain in 1999 but missed the 2001 cup treble-winning campaign through injury with fitness problems increasingly dogging his time at the club ensuring that the 1995 League Cup was his only major trophy.","Allowed to join Tottenham on a free transfer in 2002, he played 49 times over two-and-a-half years before book-ending his career playing back under his dad at Southampton, retiring in 2005 after their relegation from the Premier League.","Liverpool rating: 8","Tottenham rating: 5","Neil Ruddock","Born: Wandsworth, May 9, 1968","'Razor' was one of football's larger-than-life characters but was perhaps born a decade too late as his penchant for living life to the full off the pitch was already starting to jar against a more professional approach being adopted in the fledgling Premier League in the 1990s.","Starting his career at Millwall, Ruddock broke his leg on his Tottenham debut against Liverpool in 1986 and would make just a further 10 appearances in his first spell at the club.","Returning to Millwall, he would rebuild his reputation at Southampton and was taken back to White Hart Lane by Terry Venables in 1992 for a tribunal set fee of 750,000.","Just a year later, Evans paid 2.5million for Ruddock and his colourful stay at Anfield lasted for five years.","He was part of the 1995 League Cup-winning side and along with the likes of David James, Robbie Fowler, Jamie Redknapp, Jason McAteer and Steve McManaman part of the group of players rather infamously nicknamed 'The Spice Boys.'","Liverpool rating: 7","Tottenham rating: 6","Read More","John Scales","Born: Harrogate, July 4, 1966","The 'thinking man' among his more madcap 'Crazy Gang' team-mates at Wimbledon, Scales was part of their 1988 FA Cup-winning side that recorded a shock 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the final.","Although usually a centre-back, he actually came on for Terry Gibson as a substitute striker against the Reds at Wembley.","Roy Evans brought him to Anfield for 3.5million in 1994 and a League Cup winner with the club, he cites his highlights as being the iconic 4-3 win over Newcastle United and winning three England caps.","Scales returned to the capital two years later and despite his only goal for the club being against Liverpool in a League Cup tie, his time at Spurs was blighted by injury.","Liverpool rating: 6","Tottenham rating: 4","Read More","Graeme Souness","Born: Edinburgh, May 6, 1953","A true Anfield legend, along with home-grown hero Steven Gerrard, he is regarded as being one of the very best midfielders to earn don the Red shirt  and certainly one of the most fearsome.","Fellow Scot Alan Hansen said of him: Souness was just head and shoulders above anybody. I think Glenn Hoddle had more talent than Souness, but he was never the player that Souness was. Souness was like a giant.","He won five League Championships, three League Cups and three European Cups with Liverpool.","What is less-known is that Souness started his career with Tottenham Hotspur.","Although he was part of their 1970 FA Youth Cup-winning side, he made just a single first team appearance as a substitute in a UEFA Cup tie before moving to Middlesbrough in search of more opportunities with the teenager reputedly telling Spurs' iconic manager Bill Nicholson that he was the best player at the club.","Liverpool rating: 10","Tottenham rating: 1","Read More","Paul Walsh","Born: Plumstead, October 1, 1962","With his long blond locks, the maverick striker was compared to fellow Londoner and star of TV and radio Pat Sharp who was born less than a year before him.","Having been capped by England while with Luton Town, Walsh was snapped up by Joe Fagan for 700,000 in 1984.","He'd go on to score 37 times in 112 appearances for Liverpool and the club's most-successful manager Bob Paisley summarised his style in 1987 by saying: Paul Walsh can play teams on his own some days. When he's buzzing and bubbling he whizzes around the field like a cartoon character with the ball tied to his boot. It's like watching a film that's running too fast. You want to slow it down in order to appreciate all the tricks he's getting up to.","A member of the Reds 1986 title-winning side, he was less prolific after his move to Tottenham in 1988 but came on as a substitute in their 1991 FA Cup final success over Nottingham Forest.","Liverpool rating: 7","Tottenham rating: 6","Read More","Christian Ziege","Born: West Berlin, February 1, 1972","A highly-rated Germany international, Ziege arrived at Anfield in 2000 with a stellar reputation.","He included Bayern Munich and AC Milan on his CV and had settled into English football well with big-spending Middlesbrough.","Liverpool exploited a clause in Ziege's contract with the Teesside club though to nab him for 5.5million despite Boro insisting they'd had offers elsewhere of 8million.","However, rather than prove a great bargain, his time with the Reds was hampered by fitness problems and he was sold to Tottenham after just one season with John Arne Riise drafted in as his replacement.","He continued to spend large periods on the treatment table at Spurs and to add insult to injury, in 2002 Liverpool and Ziege were both fined for an historic illegal approach relating to his time in the North East.","Liverpool rating: 4","Tottenham rating: 5","Also played for both: Steven Caulker; Peter Crouch; Brad Friedel; Paul Konchesky; Oyvind Leonhardsen; Paul Stewart.","Read More","Must-read Liverpool FC stories from the past 24 hours","Follow us"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Add coffee","Once the water is at a rolling boil, add your favorite medium-to fine-ground coffeeabout 2 tablespoons for every 6 ounces of water in the pot. That'll yield a medium-strong cup of coffee, but feel free to adjust the amount of grounds you add (more for a stronger cup, less for weaker).","3. Give it time","As soon as the coffee grounds are in the pot, turn the stove's heat off. For the sake of the coffee, you don't actually want to boil the grounds, but you do want them to make a flavorful brew. Cover the pot once the heat is off, and wait for about 5 minutes, peeking occasionally, until the grounds have all sunk to the bottom of the pot.","4. Ladle it out","You could strain the coffee with a fine-mesh sieve or a coffee sock, but neither is really necessarythe grounds will all be at the bottom, so you can simply ladle the coffee out of the pot and into a mug.

He was there to buy pomade.","I have to get black products for my hair and thats the only section that was locked up, he said. Thats the part that I cannot understand.","He said he tracked down an employee to open the lock. The employee grabbed the $3 hair product and personally walked it to a cash register.","It just kind of threw me for a loop, he said. I didnt expect to go in there for 5 minutes and take 30 minutes inside Walmart.","KTVU went inside the Walmart in American Canyon and took pictures of the products on the shelves. Things like hair dye, shampoos, caps, combs, and brushes marketed to black people are under lock and key, while those same products for others are open on the shelves. In some cases, the products locked up are cheaper than those that arent.","This isnt the first time Walmart has been accused of locking up hair products for black people. Similar customers experiences and complaints have most recently occurred in places like Long Island, NY and Sacramento. In 2018, a woman in Southern California sued Walmart for racial discrimination.","A spokesperson for Walmart corporation sent KTVU the following statement:","We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind at Walmart. We serve more than 140 million customers weekly, crossing all demographics, and are focused on meeting their needs while providing the best shopping experience at each store. Like other retailers, Walmart uses enhanced security on some products such as electronics, automotive, cosmetics and other personal care products. Those determinations are made on a store-by-store basis using data supporting the need for the heightened measures. Our goal is to ensure that we offer a wide variety of products to our diverse array of customers at the low prices they have come to expect.","Sturghall said that response isnt good enough.","I just know that we need solutions, he said.

The ECHO's Joe Rimmer and Football.London 's Alasdair Gold gave their verdicts.. with similar results.","Joe Rimmer: Both Liverpool and Tottenham have received plenty of praise for the way they've established themselves as top Premier League clubs in recent seasons.","And rightly so.","Spurs, like Liverpool, play an exciting style of football and have mixed clever signings in the transfer market with giving young players the chance to sign in the first team.","That being said, Liverpool have kicked on this season and that is reflected in the combined XI I have picked.","The Reds have the better goalkeeper in 65m man Alisson Becker. Hugo Lloris is hugely experienced, but still a little erratic.","Trent Alexander-Arnold trumps Kieran Trippier in terms of ability and potential, while Andy Robertson has surpassed Danny Rose as one of the Premier League's best left-backs.","Virgil van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs on the planet, but I really believe that Davinson Sanchez has the potential to get close to the Dutchman one day. It's hard leaving out Joe Gomez, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, but I'm a huge fan of the Colombian.","In midfield, Fabinho has proven to be an excellent buy and Gini Wijnaldum is an underrated, unsung hero. I can't imagine any Spurs man would get in ahead of them.","Christian Eriksen is a quality player and is deservedly ahead of any of Liverpool's midfielders in the trio.","As for the front three, well there's no way I can leave out Harry Kane, is there? He's a world class centre-forward.","But as much as I like Son Heung-Min, there's no place for him ahead of Sadio Mane or Mohamed Salah.","My team: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Sanchez, Robertson; Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Eriksen; Salah, Mane, Kane","Read More","Alasdair Gold: It will be a clash of two high energy teams who like to attack at Anfield on Sunday afternoon.","Spurs have fallen well behind Liverpool in recent weeks after a dip in form but they have a three week break to think about getting back on track.","When it comes to the defence this season though, Liverpool have really tightened up at the back while Spurs have gone backwards in that area and that's reflected in my combined XI, which comes in a 4-3-3 formation.","Hugo Lloris has seen an upturn in form in the last couple of months after some high profile errors but Alisson Becker gets the nod for his consistency this season, albeit behind a more solid defence.","Spurs' full-backs have been poor this season on the whole. Danny Rose has shown some signs of returning to the player he was but ultimately they're not contributing enough at both ends of the pitch. That means Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson get the two spots.","Virgil van Dijk is one of the first names on the combined teamsheet and the choice for his partner falls on either Toby Alderweireld or Jan Vertonghen. Alderweireld has played more this season due to Vertonghen's injury midway through the campaign, but for me Vertonghen has only got better and better in recent seasons and he'll create a better balance alongside Van Dijk.","Read More","Liverpool matchday","In the middle Fabinho has been a very good buy for Liverpool and for me Moussa Sissoko has been one of the most transformed players in the Premier League this season. In recent years this would have been a crazy pick - some may still think it is - but he's been one of the league's most in-form players and this midfield will benefit from his energy.","The final spot in the centre requires a more attacking player and it comes down to either Christian Eriksen or Dele Alli. Eriksen would normally be a shoo-in but he's dipped in form this season and although Alli has missed more of the season through injury he's had a higher level over the games he's played. However, I need Eriksen's passing ability in front of two more defensive midfielders.","Up front I'm going for Harry Kane leading the line with Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah either side. That's a trio with goals aplenty in it. It's harsh on Son Heung-min, who was brilliant between November and February this season, but he's dropped off in the last month and that's why he just misses out.","My team: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Vertonghen, Robertson; Fabinho, Sissoko, Eriksen; Salah, Mane, Kane","Read More","Must-read Liverpool FC stories from the past 24 hours","Follow us"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The meeting was one of several held since Netflix and Cannes bitter spat before last years festival, which led the streamer to take Roma to Venice instead, where it won the Golden Lion.","But no solution has been found yet that would allow a Netflix title to return to Cannes competition lineup. In any case, it does not have a festival-ready film to present, sources said. Representatives for Netflix declined to comment on the matter. Cannes did not immediately respond to Varietys request for comment.","To avoid missing out on another masterwork like Roma, Fremaux has been eager to lay his hands on Martin Scorseses The Irishman, and made that clear at the Lumire Festival in Lyon, France, last October, where he sat with Sarandos, Stuber, and Cannes president Pierre Lescure. Fremaux then traveled to the Marrakech Film Festival, where Scorsese was being honored in December.","At the time, there was a strong possibility that post-production on The Irishman would be done by May, but the laborious special effects have meant that the film will not be ready for Cannes and will likely bow at the Venice Film Festival in September, before rolling out in theaters and on the streaming service in the fall.","Steven Soderberghs The Laundromat with Meryl Streep, an untitled project from Noah Baumbach, Timothee Chalamet-starrer The King and the Safdie brothers Uncut Gems were also thought to be possibilities for the Croisette, but none will enter the fray, sources said. As with last year, Netflix still plans to send an acquisition team to Cannes.","After the streamer made a splash in 2017 by getting both Tilda Swinton adventure Okja and Baumbachs starry The Meyerowitz Stories into the competition lineup, Cannes and Fremaux faced a revolt from French theater owners angry over Netflixs practice of making the films available immediately on their site. The usual process in France calls for a 36-month wait after a films theatrical release before it can head to a streaming platform.","Cannes bowed to the exhibitors, creating a rule that no film could compete for the festivals esteemed jury awards unless it was destined for release in French theaters. In response, Netflix withdrew from the fest and took its films, including Roma and Orson Welles The Other Side of the Wind, to Venice. Cannes 2018 slate was heavily criticized for its weak American presence, and the absence of Netflix in the official selection was one of the most talked-about issues on the Croisette.","The Cannes-Netflix relationship has continued to obsess industry players and journalists, leading some to make fanciful speculations as to how their standoff might end. One scenario entailed an extended local run in French theaters for Cannes award-winning Netflix films before the titles are made available on the streaming service; another suggested that those films be temporarily removed from Netflixs platform in France for the duration of their theatrical release. But neither of these scenarios is conceivable for local exhibitors, according to a source at the Federation of French Exhibitors.","This years program is shaping up to be stronger on the American front. With Quentin Tarantinos Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and James Grays Ad Astra among the several English-language movies strongly tipped for the competition (which would mean two Brad Pitt moments at the Palais), the festival should not be short of glittery options.","Power of Women","Watch Bette Midler's Impassioned Plea for a More Just, Civilized and Loving Planet","Christiane Amanpour: 'We Are Bludgeoned Over the Head by Untruthful Trope of Fake News'","Taraji P.

Octobers Lion Air flight 610 crash was also operated by a MAX 8. Due to the deadly crashes involving the aircraft just months apart, multiple airlines around the world have grounded the MAX 8s in their fleets. US carriers and other North American airlines, however, have said their MAX 8s will continue to fly.","Despite this, on Monday, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), Sarah Nelson, released a statement calling for the US Federal Aviation Administration to conduct an investigation of the aircraft.","It is vitally important that U.S. airlines work with Boeing, the FAA, and the NTSB to address concerns and take steps to ensure confidence for the traveling public and working crews, Nelson says in the statement. While it is important that we not draw conclusions without all of the facts, in the wake of a second accident, regulators, manufacturers,and airlines must take steps to address concerns immediately. AFA is formally requesting the FAA conduct an investigation into the 737 MAX.","Nelson also highlighted the similarities between the Ethiopian crash and theLion Air crash. Aside from the same aircraft, both crashes happened within 20 minutes of takeoff and both flight crews struggled to maintain a steady, upward climb.","North American airlines that have the Boeing 737 MAX 8 in their fleets include American Airlines, Westjet, Air Canada, Aeromexico, COPA and Southwest.TPGreached out to the airlines to see what their plans were, but none of the airlines responded to phone calls or emails within a timely manner aside from Southwest.

In the words of Shashi Tharoor, an Indian parliamentarian: The colonial project of divide et impera (divide and rule) fomented religious antagonisms to facilitate continued imperial rule and reached its tragic culmination in 1947. Some academics go even further, arguing that the very religious identities of Hindus and Muslims in the subcontinent were constructed by the British, and as such, the subsequent strife between these groups was a function of this policy.","In other words, most of South Asias contemporary geopolitical and ethno-religious problems, including the Kashmir conflict, the division of British India into India and Pakistan, and communal strife between Hindus and Muslims,are the result of Western influence. In this view, everyone in South Asia lived in relative harmony together before the 19th century. Often, British policies such as the 1909 decision to give Indian Muslims a separate electorate from Hindus in local elections, as well as the British role in Indias 1947 partition, are cited as proof of this policy to sow conflict between Indians. However, on the other hand, the work of historians like Ajay Verghese, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, have demonstrated that areas in India formerly governed by princely states have more communal riots than the provinces in India ruled directly by the Raj.","The idea of communal harmony and unity flies in the face of historical evidence and native literature, as well as South Asians own memories and interpretations of their own identities and histories. The British Raj was not some totalitarian regime that had the ability, even if it so desired, to create conflict and entire religious categoriesfrom nothing in South Asia. It was a highly complex entity that was the result of the interplay between British interests, local groups, and rulers (princes), and as the 19th century wore on, organized movements of the middle-class Indian professionals. As the blogger and geneticist Razib Khan, who focuses heavily on South Asia, noted, The reason I have no patience for the constant indictments of the British is that South Asian elites had their own agency, and their own history, long before the British became the major power in the subcontinent, and retained that agency after. (For a full treatment of Khans analysis of the thousand-year history of Hindu-Muslim relations in South Asia, see his post here.)","Indias partition and the conflict over Kashmir, a Muslim-majority princely state ruled by a Hindu dynasty, were driven by local interests and philosophy, including the two-nation theory, which held that the Muslims of British India should be granted their own country, Pakistan. According to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan:","Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs and literary traditions. They neither intermarry nor eat together, and indeed they belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions.","This view of Hindus and Muslims belonging to two different civilizations is problematic for many modern thinkers, who seek in the British Raj an explanation for the subcontinents divides. Was this divide  the different social customs and philosophies that Jinnah referred to  the result of a colonial plot? Or is there a deeper civilizational divide?","There is no doubt that often aspects of Hindu and Islamic, particularly Persian and Turkic, cultures influenced each other. As it is often pointed out, at the village level Hindus and Muslims shared a wide spectrum of customs and beliefs, at times even jointly worshiping the same saint or holy spot.","Cynthia Talbot, a historian who focuses on pre-colonial India,argues that while no one would deny that modernization has led to the sharper articulation of identities encompassing broad communities modern identities do not spring fully fashioned out of nowhere. They commonly employ the myths and symbols of earlier forms of identity that may be less clearly formulated and more restricted in circulation but are nonetheless incipient cores of ethnicity. In her book India Before Europe, she writes, Although the religious beliefs and practices of India were never systematized by a central institution or spiritual authority, the circulation of Sanskrit and Brahmins throughout the subcontinent did produce some semblance of a unified religious culture at the elite level by 1000 CE. Other scholars argue that the arrival and conquest of Muslim others caused the various related native traditions to reify as Hinduism, a process that began long before the British arrived. Thus, there was an indigenous self-awareness of a native tradition distinct from the newly introduced Islam, though the term Hinduism was not yet fully in place.","On the other hand, Islam, like Christianity, was more self-aware of its distinct and often exclusionary identity from its onset. Local spiritual practices notwithstanding, most Muslim elites in South Asia were strongly aware of their unique cultural identity  with significant influence from the Middle East  separate from the more subcontinent-centric Hindus, even if they were not particularly religious, and even if they got along well with Hindus. The process of modernization, regardless of British involvement, expanded literacy, urbanization, and led to the movement of ideology from the elite to the masses, as Khan argues. Moreover, confessionalization in some sense is part of the process of modernity and development, along with the expansion of the literate class.","Therefore, the division between Hindus and Muslims in South Asia is nobodys fault or plot, really, but a natural consequence of the emergence of a mass political culture. The reason for this divide is because Hindus and Muslims in the subcontinent naturally have utilized different points of reference when drawing upon history to articulate their sociopolitical goals and build their modern identities. Such thinking is not rare. In 18th and 19th century Europe, thinkers looked back to different periods of European history for inspiration. While the Enlightenment was more neoclassical in nature, and drew upon Europes Greco-Roman heritage, the subsequent Romantic movement idealized the medieval period, and as such, was very different in its philosophy. Unlike in Europe, in South Asia, the thinkers and elites who looked back to their regions respective classical and medieval periods were not the same individuals, and often belonged to different religious groups.","No matter how much syncretism and fluidity there may have been, it would have been difficult for Indias two sets of elites the Hindu brahmin-kshatriya combine on one hand, and the Perso-Turkic Muslims  to have agreed upon which aspects of Indias history to draw upon to build modern identities. It is true that Akbar and several other Mughal rulers patronized brahmins and sages, while Muslims served in elite roles in the armies of Hindu states like Vijayanagara, Mysore, and the Maratha Empire. But the ultimate cultural orientations of Hindu and Muslims states were different, and invariably Hindu and Muslim rulers in modern India would cleave toward their own sectarian preferences.","The case of the state of Mysore is instructive in this sense: while it was ruled by the Hindu Wodeyar dynasty, the court language and religion were Kannada and Hinduism, but when the state came under the rule of Muslims, Hyder Ali, and his son, Tipu Sultan, Persian language and literature and Islam were given courtly prominence. For this reason, the two-nation theory is not an idea that came out of nowhere. The Muslims of South Asia look to the glorious days of the Mughal Empire, and the flowery literature of Persian and Urdu, written in the Arabic script, for symbolism and inspiration, while Hindus look to the Mauryan and Gupta Empires, their ancient epics, and the Hindu golden age. When much of north India came under the rule of Muslim dynasties, naturally state funds and support went more toward mosques and centers of Islamic learning than to Hindu temples and philosophical institutions. This lack of state patronage is thought to have changed the nature of Hinduism by favoring the aspects of it that were more family and village oriented.","One solution would have been for the modern Indian state, unpartitioned, to have had two sets of symbols and mottoes, for Hindus and Muslims (though what of the Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Zoroastrians, and other religious groups?). But modern nation building is about articulating a unifying set of national principles, whether ethnic, cultural, or civic. It is the conditions of modernity and the nation-state that allow and spur Indias two largest groups, Hindus and Muslims, to articulate different visions of the future, which can be seen through the different articulations of identity and history in India and Pakistan, the latter of which is the state-level manifestation of the intellectual consciousness of South Asian Muslims, despite the existence of Bangladesh, and despite there being hundreds of millions of Muslims in India.","Even when India was founded as a secular country after independence, it still draw upon much of the symbolism of ancient, pre-Islamic India, from the wheel in the middle of its flag, a symbol taken from the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, to its national motto, taken from the Hindu Upanishads, and written out in the native Devanagari script,   satyameva jayate (truth alone triumphs). It is not unnatural that India drew upon its ancient heritage and the Sanskrit language in the way many Western countries draw upon Latin and some Christian symbolism. But the Muslim elites of South Asia had something very different in mind. For example, Pakistans national motto features three words all derived from and written in the Arabic script,    iman, ittihad, nazm (faith, unity, discipline). Clearly these are two visions that would have been hard to reconcile in the context of the development of modern identities and nation-states.","As the author and Nobel laureate V.S. Naipaul wrote in India: A Million Mutinies Now, it was perhaps only a matter of time before modern India, with its Hindu majority, looked back to those ancient roots to rebrand itself for modernity:","What I hadnt understood in 1962, or had taken too much for granted, was the extent to which the country had been remade; and even the extent to which India had been restored to itself, after its own equivalent of the Dark Ages  after the Muslim invasions and the detailed, repeated vandalizing of the North, the shifting empires, the wars, the 18th-century anarchy. The twentieth-century restoration of India to itself had taken time; it could even seem like a kind of luck. It had taken much to create a Bengali reformer like Ram Mohun Roy (born in 1772); it had taken much more to create Gandhi (born in 1869). The British peace after the 1857 Mutiny can be seen as a kind of luck. It was a time of intellectual recruitment. India was set on the way of a new kind of intellectual life; it was given new ideas about its history and civilization.","Of course none of this is to argue that Hindus and Muslims can not, and should not, get along well with each other and synthesize their cultures. They ought to, and moreover, South Asian states should continue to extend full political liberties to all people regardless of religion, ethnicity, language, or nation. But in the process of drawing upon ancient histories for creating modern national national identities, it was inevitable, perhaps, that there would be some tension between the two differing visions articulated by different elites and communities in the subcontinent, because they derive from two different social and religious ideologies, and have different visions of the modern state. Thus, Hindu-Muslim conflict in South Asia derives from no one particular factor, but is a function of the friction between different communities with different modernizing visions.

Prior to the officers' arrival, more information was received and the call was upgraded to a physical fight between two men. When the officers arrived, they found a vehicle stopped in the roadway with the hazard lights on. The officers attempted to contact two men outside of the vehicle, who refused to talk to them before contacting an attorney. The men started to walk away. Because the car was in the roadway, the officers said they would have to tow it. The two men walked back, arguing with the officers, stating they couldn't tow the vehicle. At that time, a records check revealed the car was an outstanding stolen vehicle from Scottsdale, Arizona.  The officers attempted to detain both men, who refused to comply with the officers' directions and a struggle ensued. One of the individuals was taken to the ground before he could be detained. When the struggle was over and both men were detained, the officers contacted the Scottsdale Police Department. At that time it was determined the vehicle was a valid stolen vehicle, however, the theft was based upon failure to meet financial obligations by the purchaser, who was one of the two men. Because of that, the officers elected to release the two men and towed the vehicle.  Because of allegations, the Professional Standards Bureau of the Phoenix Police Department is investigating this incident. Investigators would like to speak with both men, who have refused the attempts made thus far to contact them.","Report a typo","Watch local news that matters on ABC15 Mornings!","Social"],"targetCaptions":[]}

However, we did get lots of other details besides that, including the basics of what Stadia is: Google's vision for a new kind of gaming service powered by the cloud. You'll be able to play games, even high-end ones like Assassin's Creed Odyssey or Doom Eternal, on most any internet-connected device.","As well as offering cloud streaming of games to phones, laptops, PCs, and TVs, it will also launch with its own controller. In addition, the company has founded a first-party development house to make games exclusively for Stadia.","Stadia will support cross-platform multiplayer and allow you to seamlessly switch between devices. You can also simply click a link while watching a game on YouTube to dive into that very same game at the exact same point. Alternatively, streamers can allow viewers to sign up to join in to play in the same game session with them. All of this is done seamlessly; you don't have to download anything or have specific, high-end hardware to play.","At launch, Stadia will support 4K HDR gameplay at 60 FPS, with plans to scale that up to 8K at 120 FPS. Ubisoft, Doom Eternal developer Id Software, and Q-Games were among the developers mentioned as partners at Google's GDC conference, while more than 100 studios already have Stadia in their hands.

{"id":"1104037531555893250","postTimestamp":"Fri Mar 08 15:13:54 +0000 2019","postText":["For Bryce Harper, a Philly survival guide presented by Pete Rose | Inquirer https://t.co/86Ey13QR8r"],"postMedia":[],"targetTitle":"For Bryce Harper, a Philly survival guide presented by Pete Rose ","targetDescription":"If anyone is qualified to brace Bryce for what to expect from his new city, its Charlie Hustle.","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["CLEARWATER, Fla.  Pete Rose heard that Bryce Harper wanted to meet him.","It was 2015, and Harper was having the best offensive season of the post-steroid era, one in which he would be crowned MVP of the National League. In a stroke of serendipity, Rose happened to be visiting Cincinnati, his native city, at the same time the Washington Nationals were in town to play the Reds. This, he figured, would be his chance.","So I went down to the ballpark and around to the visitors clubhouse, Rose said by phone this week. But he was out on the field taking batting practice, and I couldnt meet him.","Four years later, Rose and Harper still havent been introduced, even though they both live in Las Vegas and have a mutual admiration. Harper, who appreciates baseball history, lists Rose as one of his idols, an opinion formed by the stories hes heard from his father; Rose believes Harper is among the top handful of players in the game today.","But now that Harper has signed a record-setting, 13-year, $330 million deal with the Phillies, meeting Rose is almost an imperative. Because 40 years ago, Rose was Harper, the superstar free agent who got big bucks to come to Philadelphia and deliver a World Series championship.","And if anyone is qualified to brace Bryce for what to expect from his new city, its most certainly Charlie Hustle.","I always respected Bryce Harper because the guys a good player, Rose said. The guy was a good player when he was 10 and a better player when he was 15, and now hes a better, better player and hes [26]. Theres pressure on a guy like that. Not pressure to hit 40 home runs. Hell hit the home runs. Hell knock in runs. Hell play defense. Theres pressure on a guy like that to win.","Rose had already won two World Series with Cincinnatis Big Red Machine when he chose the Phillies four-year, $3.24 million offer over more attractive deals from the St. Louis Cardinals, Kansas City Royals and Atlanta Braves, among others in the 1978-79 offseason. He was 37 and had more than 3,100 career hits. He was, even by then, an all-time great.","But Rose was also viewed as the player who could put the Phillies over the top after their three consecutive seasons of losing in the NL Championship Series. And in the 30 days after Rose signed, the Phillies sold $3 million worth of tickets, according to the book written by former team president Bill Giles.","Harper is younger and therefore less accomplished, but he brings similar star power. The Phillies sold 220,000 tickets in three days after signing Harper, including 100,000 on the afternoon that he agreed to a contract, according to Phillies senior vice president of ticket operations John Weber. In the 24 hours after Harpers deal became official, his No. 3 jersey was the best seller of any jersey launch in any sport, Fanatics announced.","Rose, 77 and banned from baseball for the past 30 years for betting on games when he managed the Reds, said he watches most of Harpers games on television. He admires Harpers power and marvels at the violence of his swing, even with two strikes.","He dont cut down on that swing at all, Rose said. I don't understand how a guy can hit .330 [in 2015] and continue to swing the bat like he does.","In 1979, Rose hit .331 with 208 hits and a league-leading .418 on-base percentage. But the Phillies finished in fourth place, and manager Danny Ozark got fired midway through the season. A year later, Rose helped the Phillies to their first World Series championship. They won the pennant again in 1983, his final year with the team.","Rose understands, then, that Phillies fans are notoriously demanding. The thunderous ovation that Harper will receive on opening day at Citizens Bank Park will dissipate quickly if he doesnt put up big numbers and the team doesnt win.","My advice to Harper is this: Dont ever give the people of Philly a chance to get on you. What I mean by that is hustle, Rose said. Play hard, and they will never bother you. I had it figured this way: Philly fans want two things. They want to win, which they should, and they want you to bust your ass, which every player should want to do. I think once youre there for a while, you learn that.","I dont ever remember Philadelphia getting on a guy or booing a guy out of town that was a guy that played hard. They just dont do it. Theyre good fans. Theyre passionate fans. I dont give a [bleep] how much money Bryce Harper makes. Its hard for a fan to boo a guy thats busting his ass.","Harper is known mostly for playing hard, crashing into enough outfield walls that Rose once called him reckless. But Harper also has had a few lapses, famously getting into a physical altercation in the dugout with then-Nationals closer Jonathan Papelbon late in the 2015 season for not running out a fly ball.","That woke Bryce up, said Rose. He hasnt had that kind of situation since, and he probably wont. I dont think anyone has to worry one iota about Bryce Harper not playing hard this year for the Phillies.","Rose said it worries me some that the Nationals never won a series in four trips to the playoffs with Harper. But he still lists Harper, Mike Trout, and Mookie Betts as the best players in the game. Rose also believes Harper is surrounded by enough talent  notably slugger Rhys Hoskins, ace Aaron Nola, and offseason additions Andrew McCutchen, Jean Segura, and J.T. Realmuto  that he said he cant wait to get back to Vegas and bet on the Phillies.","All Bryce Harper's got to do is go in there, do his job, and hope he lifts other people to do better than they can do, Rose said. Great players make other players better, and I suspect that Bryce Harper will make a lot of Philadelphia Phillie players better players. And thats all the Phillies fans can ask from him.","But will that be enough for fans who havent seen winning baseball since 2011?","Rose laughs at the question. Maybe he and Harper can discuss it someday.","The biggest stories for Phillys biggest sports fans","The biggest stories for Phillys biggest sports fans"," Copyright 2019, Philadelphia Media Network (Newspapers), LLC Terms of Use/Privacy Policy"," Copyright 2019, Philadelphia Media Network (Newspapers), LLC Terms of Use/Privacy Policy"],"targetCaptions":[]}

These are the vitamins, minerals, and herbs that support healthy skin and may help stop those embarrassing breakouts.","Finding the causes of acne","Tatiana Ayazo/RD.com","Keep spotting zits? Before you even think about popping them, find out which of these sneaky reasons led to the breakout. Yes, acne occurs when pores clog with oil and dead skin cells, but identifying theunderlying source(hormonal imbalance, allergies, weakened immune system, etc.) of your acne is the first step to getting rid of zits for good. A great place to start is getting the right nutrients, which is where vitamins for acne come in handy.","There are many supplements that skin experts suggest to clients based on their particular needs. Specific amounts of these supportive nutrients vary by person, health status, medications, or other illnesses, saysJulia Scalise, DN, PhD, doctor of naturology and holistic health consultant. For this reason, it is always best to work with knowledgeable practitioners to discover the underlying causes of acne for you and use supplements that are suited to your needs in the amounts appropriate for you. Ahead are some of the best-known supplements that could lead to clearer skin. (Heres what you need to know about supplements before you begin.)","Vitamin A","Tatiana Ayazo/RD.com","Two of the key roles vitamin A plays in your body are both incredibly beneficial for your largest organ: your skin. Not only does vitamin A protect against the suns harmful rays, but it also helps fight infection and inflammationand even slows down signs of aging. Thats why retinol, a vitamin A derivative, is a go-to ingredient in prescribed treatments for keeping skin firm, youthfulfree of acne. Several studies back up this theory, showing a reduction in acne-related skin conditions when retinol-containing serums and other skin-care products were used. The research shows that its best to use vitamin A topically as opposed to in supplement form, especially when acne is concerned, since digesting a dose of more than 10,000 international unites (IUs) can lead to a condition known as hypervitaminosis A. Find out which acne treatments dermatologists use on themselves.","Vitamin C","Tatiana Ayazo/RD.com","Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) plays a key role in collagen synthesis, or the process by which collagen is created. Collagen is a protein thats found in nearly all parts of our body, mainly our muscles, bones, blood vessels, digestive system, and skin. We tend to lose collagen as we age, which is why our skin becomes looser with less elasticity. Recently, vitamin C has emerged as an acne treatment solution instead of antibiotics. It is well known in the medical field that vitamin C has powerful anti-inflammatory properties and can be used to safely treat various skin diseases. says Ron Choi, Global Business Manager forVitabrid C. When vitamin C is supplied directly to the skin, it promotes collagen synthesis, inhibits melanin production, and scavenges free radicals, thereby restoring and brightening damaged skin left in the wake of an acne breakout. These are the foods that cause and clear acne.","B vitamins","Tatiana Ayazo/RD.com","The b in B-complex vitamins might as well stand for beauty, because several of them, particularly B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), and B6 (pyridoxine) play an overall role in physiological function, according to Dr. Scalise. B vitamins assist in enzyme activation but also have multiple functions in the bodyfor hormone production and balance. When it comes to your skin, B vitamins aid in reducing dryness and flakiness associated with acne, which is why theyre found in plenty of topical moisturizers. However, you can also take them in supplement form. Here are some signs of a vitamin B deficiency.","Zinc","Tatiana Ayazo/RD.com","Whether taken orally or topically, zinc is a nutrient that can reduce acne inflammation significantly. In fact, one double-blind study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, which analyzed the differences in female patients who were using a zinc-containing lotion to clear up their skin and those who were not, found that those using the lotion experienced clearer skin. Doses higher than 30 mg, however, may be toxic, so its important to make sure youre taking the right amount. Speak with your primary care physician or dermatologist if youre unclear of zincs effects on your skin. Dont miss Dr. Pimple Poppers acne-fighting rules everyone should memorize.","Vitamin E","Tatiana Ayazo/RD.com","This fat-soluble vitamin is also an antioxidant, which means it helps prevent fats from oxidizing in the body. This is especially important when it comes to your skin, as the oxidation of sebum (the oily substance that comes out of your whiteheads and blackheads when you pop them) is known to spread bacteria across your face and lead to acne. Vitamin E helps prevent this spread of bacteria, and also ensures that vitamin A functions properly on the skin. Vitamin E is a popular ingredient in skin-care products and also occurs naturally in deliciously healthy foods, like almonds, avocados, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, spinach, and more.","Vitamin D","Tatiana Ayazo/RD.com","This nutrient not only keeps bones strong, but also plays a vital role in skin health. Most of us get this nutrient from exposure to the suns UV rays, so if you live in northern areas of the country that dont see much warm sunlight, especially in winter, you might be deficient in vitamin D. In fact, according to the journal Nutrition Research, nearly half of all U.S. adults are deficient in vitamin D. Another study, published in PLOS One, which analyzed vitamin Ds impact on patients suffering from acne, found that those more likely to suffer from acne also suffered from a vitamin D deficiency. Make sure you know the signs of a vitamin D deficiency,and if youre running low, consider a supplement.ZSS Clear Skin Supplementscontain 1,000 IUs of vitamin D, or 250 percent of your daily dose, in addition to other skin-friendly nutrients, including zinc.","Selenium","Tatiana Ayazo/RD.com","This nutrient is known to fight against illnesses such as heart disease and cancer, but one thing its less known for is its ability to ward off acne. In fact, one study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Acta Dermato-Venereologica, found that among people suffering from acne, those with the most severe cases also showed significantly lower levels of selenium. To give your skin a fighting chance against acne, load up on selenium-containing foods, such as Brazil nuts, Yellowfin tuna, halibut, sardines, and grass-fed beef.","Next, find out about the skin conditions that look like acne but arent.","Sign Up for Our Newsletters","Reader Interactions","Sign Up for Our Newsletters"],"targetCaptions":[]}

The club is now playing attacking football again and the defense has also shaped well to an extent. Most importantly, players such as Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford, and Romelu Lukaku have done well under the Norwegian which is a big boost for the club.","However, Manchester United is still far from becoming a potent force yet again in Europe and to make that happen, the upcoming transfer window will be an important one for the club. If Machester United must reach the level of Manchester City or Liverpool, the Red Devils must smartly invest in a few impact players for the club.","This summer, the club must focus on bringing a few proven and experienced players to Old Trafford which would complement really well with the in-form youngsters at the club.","On that note, here are 3 players who can make Manchester United a really strong side if they sign them in the summer:","#3 Toby Alderweireld","Toby Alderweireld was a major defensive target for Manchester United last summer. However, the move did not materialize and the Belgian remained at Tottenham Hotspurs. However, Alderweireld is yet again being linked with a move to Manchester United.","Alderweireld is someone who can play at both the heart of the defense and also as a full-back. This could be an important factor for Manchester United to consider as they have suffered due to injuries to their defenders this season.","The Belgian is a strong physical presence at the back and is also capable of playing attacking football. He will be available for a cut-price option this summer and hence, he is one player who could make Manchester United a strong team next season."],"targetCaptions":[]}

It raises similar questions about charities that promote sharia courts and beth dins  councils which rule on matters involving disputes in the Islamic and Jewish communities respectively.","The society argues such activities can have a fragmentary effect on British society. Its chief executive officer, Stephens Evans, has written to the chair of the Charity Commission, Baroness Stowell, calling for a re-think on whether such organisations should continue to qualify for charitable status.","Not only has religion ceased to be the force for social cohesion that it once was, the rise of religious fundamentalism has also demonstrated how religion can exacerbate tension, division, segregation and conflict in Britain, Evans writes. As such, we believe there is a clear need now to consider whether the advancement of religion should be regarded as an inherent public good, deserving of the status of a charitable purpose.","The report suggests many religious charities are politicised. It cites the examples of several whose members have been shown to promote extremist views.","Charities cannot take their privileged place in society for granted, Evans said. They must show they deserve it. Too many faith-based charities are causing harm at the expense of the taxpayer. Tax breaks are allowing these organisations, under the guise of charity, to facilitate harmful activities that do not align with British values and opinion.","Nearly half of all UK overseas charities are faith-based, the report finds. Around 30 are now supported by the government compared with only two a couple of years ago, according to the society, which warns that some Christian charities have used poverty and humanitarian tragedies as a means to evangelise to children, often in Muslim-majority countries.","More than a quarter of the religious charities that enjoy an annual income of over 10m exist solely to promote their religion, the analysis finds.","Advancing religion is not an unqualified good, Evans said. In some cases it has no public benefit and in others it is actively harmful. Religious organisations that wish to be registered as charities should be required to demonstrate that they serve a genuine public benefit under another charitable heading, for example because they alleviate poverty.","Dan Corry, chief executive of New Philanthropy Capital, which offers advice to charities, said many of the UKs most illustrious charities had been founded by religious groups and that the relationship between both sectors was entrenched.","Some of them only work with people of their faith, some are very inclusive. Most people are happy with religious charities. Interestingly, they often work with people who no one else will work with. But there will always be some who really should not be classed as a charity.","A Charity Commission spokeswoman said: We are aware of the National Secular Societys report on charity and will review it carefully. As a general principle: like all charities, a small proportion of religious charities are misused by others and used in ways the public would not expect. The Commission deals with these issues robustly where they arise."," This article was amended on 19 March 2019 to clarify that the report refers to charities that support the non-stun slaughter of animals for halal meat and for kosher meat.","Most popular"],"targetCaptions":[]}

His Batman is why I do what I do. In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I fell in love with his comic book-accurate interpretation of the Caped Crusader. It was a breath of fresh air and it felt like we finally had the one true Batman.","Three years have quickly sped by and we're officially going to receive a new Batman for his next movie. Last night, Ben Affleck announced that he will not return as the Dark Knight in Matt Reeves' The Batman and now everyone's attention has moved towards wanting to know who the nextBruce Waynewill be. Matt Reeves is said to want an actor that's around 20 years younger than Affleck while Warner Bros. wants someone older. My guess is that Reeves wants a fresh start while the studio wants an older actor for crossover potential.","In this list, I will discuss the actors I think can replace Ben Affleck as Batman using the parameters that Matt Reeves and Warner Bros. want. Hit Next to see our picks to play the Batman.","Michael Fassbender","Michael Fassbender is an X-Men alum and no stranger to comic book franchises. The actor has shown multiple levels of range and could definitely handle the Batman/Bruce Wayne personality. If they go with the older range for the next Dark Knight, then Fassbender is probably one of the best choices to take over the role.","Ben Barnes","Ben Barnes is out of a job after The Punisher season 2 and he's one of the best actorsin thatseries. The second season tied up Barnes' arc on The Punisher and the actor has already told us that that he'd love to play the Caped Crusader. Barnes definitely has the pretty boylook going on for him and I wonder what his take on Bruce Wayne could be.","Ryan Gosling","I've said this before and I'll say it again: Ryan Gosling needs to star in a superhero movie. I've always thought Gosling would make a great Batman. Every role that he's done has shown us his capability and he could crush it as Bruce Wayne.","Jon Hamm","Jon Hamm is my top choice for an older Batman. If Warner Bros. wants to cast an older actor for crossover potential, Jon Hamm isthe studio's best bet. He has a similar look to Ben Affleck, and c'mon, the guy's look just screams Bruce Wayne.","Armie Hammer","Armie Hammer is 32 years old and was cast asthe Caped Crusaderin George Miller's Justice League: Mortal. That film will never see the light of day, but that doesnt mean that Hammer doesn't deserve a second shot at being the Batman. He's charming, broody and will probably give his all for this role. Armie Hammer is a great option because he's young enough for Matt Reeves and Warner Bros. could work in a way forhimto crossover with the rest of the DC Extended Universe.","Michael Mistroff","He will reactivate his Twitter when hes done writing, or setup the @JamesWan/@theJamesWan handle.","he was being harassed by DAGAs .","Follow Us","Newsletter","Popular Stories","Recent Stories","Banner Illustration by Tom Barton\n\nPrivacy Terms | Copyright Inquiries\n\nHeroic Hollywood  2018"],"targetCaptions":[]}

We now have more reporting on the subject, and it sounds like Brown would not have reported to the Bills if he had been dealt there, turning this mess a whole lot messier:","That last part  the market is pretty bleak  spells it out. It seemed like there was optimism a deal would get done, giving both Brown and the Steelers the divorce both parties so desperately need.","Now? We know whos in control: Its Brown, not the Steelers.","If the two franchises were indeed close to a trade and it was Browns agent Drew Rosenhaus who said he wouldnt report, then theres nothing the Steelers can do. Their next step, then, is to shuffle to Rosenhaus and quietly ask for a list of teams Brown would play for. And that means Browns trade value just took yet another hit. The franchises he would play for can use the argument that the Steelers have no choice. And they dont.","As a reminder, Brown will leave a massive amount of dead money on the Steelers salary cap after he signed a four-year, $68 million contract last year. Its actually possible they could cut him before hes paid a roster bonus later this month and just eat all of that cap space. So, at the very least, they want something back for one of the best receivers in football. For a team that trades for the mercurial Brown, they would get him at a bargain price (although would he get a revised contract with his new team?)","Sure, they could send him into football purgatory by telling him to sit while they pay him millions, but the Steelers would rather shut the door on the distractions Brown brings and get compensation in the process.","Last month, Steelers GM Kevin Colbert said, We will only make a trade if it benefits the Pittsburgh Steelers.","Now, its only going to happen if it benefits Brown.","Antonio Brown, NFL, Pittsburgh Steelers, NFL","Charles Curtis","Charles is a writer for For The Win.

Your agent at the time probably says yes, you should do it.","So you just go with the flow at the time. But when you look back, as much as I enjoyed writing it, its not really necessarily what I think now.","You get older, wiser and youve got more opinions. Youve seen more and Ive obviously had a full career since then. So I decided that it would have been nice to write a book, for a few reasons really.","One was to have a keepsake and to put down what I feel and what happened in my career. But also, more so than most, I reckon my career has split a lot of opinion... I constantly get asked the same questions regarding the teams that I have played for.","Now aged 39, Owen frankly discussed the abuse he regularly receives on social media sites and hopes being able to re-tell his version of events will offer supporters  and critics  a chance to see things in a new light.","I get a fair amount of stick on social media and through things like that, you can do a million interviews but no-one seems to get the message once for all, he said.","At least if its in black and white, I can tell everybody exactly how I feel, what happened, the situations and all the little nuances that nobody knows anything about.","Owens first book was made public before his controversial switch to Real Madrid in August 2004, although more chapters were added in 2006 to reflect the events of the dramatic transfer away from Anfield.","Follow reporter Paul Gorst on social media","To follow Paul on Twitter, click here","You can read more of his stories here","Email him on paul.gorst@reachplc.com","Or contact Paul on Facebook if you want to share any news, stories or updates.","Keep up to date with the latest Liverpool news here or Everton here","The new offering will now hand Owen the opportunity to print a different perspective on how the move to the Spanish capital came to pass.","Also, when youre playing in your career, youve not really got a voice in terms of saying certain things, so its been really enjoyable doing, therapeutic almost to get it all out and say what has happened, he added.","As you say, my first book was up until 2006 but really I wanted to re-write all the stuff before that too, because you have a different perspective on life nearly 15 years later.","But that is it, theres a massively different perspective and with more opinion. And Id like to think more of a balanced opinion as well, being out of the frying pan so to speak with all the pressure and the media spotlight.","Now, I am doing it in my own time, jotting down what I want to get across, what I want to say, how I feel about certain things. So, its been great for me I think, mentally.","And itll be even better for me when it is out there and everyone can see and read for themselves how I felt and more to the point, how certain situations led me into certain things.","And itll be nice to get down and whenever anyone gives me stick again, I can just tell them they can read it in my book!","For the full video interview, go to www.reachsport.com","Stayed tuned for part two where Owen gives a frank insight into the final years of his career.","Read More","Liverpool tactics and stats","Follow us"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Poorly received by critics and a flop at the box office,Justice League endured a troubled production thatsawJoss Whedon brought in for rewrites beforeultimately serving as director for the extensive reshoots the film underwentafter Snyder stepped away.","Whedon reportedly reshot somewhere between 15-20%of the film in order to lighten the tone and shorten the runtime, the latter of which was mandated by Warner Bros.' then-CEO, Kevin Tsujihara. This represented a significant departure from previous films within the DC Extended Universe, most notably those directed by Snyder, which were considerably darker in tone and featuredruntimes eclipsing 140 minutes.","RELATED: Justice League Photographer Casts Doubt on 'Snyder Cut'","Most critical of the theatrical cut ofJustice League were die-hard Snyder fans, who felt they were robbed of the culmination of the director's vision for the DC Extended Universe launched by 2013'sMan of Steel. In the days following the release ofthe ensemble film, a petition demanding the release of the Snyder Cut was launched and went on to be signed bynearly 180,000 people. The petitionwas based on the premise that the disappointing critical response to the film andits poor showing at the box office should be attributed to Whedon's directing, largely pointing tohis use of humor, as well as Wthe decision to cut the runtime down to two hours.","Die-hard Snyder fans have been vocal in their demand for the Snyder Cut to be released by Warner Bros. despite denials thatit even exists from the film studio. Some close to Snyder, including DC storyboard artist Jay Oliva, countered the denials claiming that Snyder had shot all the planned scenes for his version of the film andhad assembled a rough, unpolished cut of the film prior to stepping away, which has likely aided in the continued demand for the Snyder Cut over 16 months after the film's release.","Zack Snyder has remained relatively quiet on the existence of the Snyder Cut, leaking some details from his vision for the film and thanking fans for their support, but never confirming the existence of a finished cut of the film.That, however, has seemingly changed following aDirector's Cut Event he hosted in California over the weekend, which involved screenings of three of his previous director's cuts and panels featuring special guests from the casts and crews of the movies showcased.","RELATED: Darkseid Was Going to Kill Lois Lane in Zack Snyder's Justice League","An attendee of the event posted a photo of him shaking Snyder's hand, accompanied by the claim that he asked the director face to face about the Snyder Cut, which Snyder then confirmed to exist. \"Even though I wasn't able to ask my question during the Q&A I did get the chance to ask Zack face to face about the Snyder cut,\" the attendee wrote. \"He said 'the movie is done, it exists' but basically it is up to WB. He is not aware that WB has any plans to release. Bittersweet #ReleaseTheSnyderCut.\"","The user later posted a video of the director confirming that the Snyder Cut is a real thing to another attendee. The user also utilized his interaction with Snyder to urge fans to \"ramp up the pressure\" on Warner Bros. to release the Snyder cut.","There is a video floating around now where someone actually filmed him saying it is done. If this is not enough evidence that the Snyder Cut exists and IS DONE, then I can't help you. Major credit to @Woke_master for capturing this on video. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut pic.twitter.com/CY9xOmfSkx","However, another fan who attended the event, tweeted that Snyder revealed there are a number of different cuts, and that he would need to finish the film before it could be released, if ever. \"Zack told me that he doesnt know because[WB] owns the movie,\" the user wrote. \"And there is actually 10 different cuts. And that he would have to finish it.\"","So it seems that a Snyder Cut (or several) may actually exist, or, rather, it could exist if Snyder was given the opportunity to finish it by Warner Bros. This isn't a likely development, of course, given the studiohas already demonstrated they have little to no interest in releasing a Snyder Cut, or any further alternate versions ofJustice League for that matter. And why would it?","RELATED: Zack Snyder Says His Justice League Plans Were 'Better' Than Flashpoint","The studio reportedly lost $60 million onJustice League's theatrical release, and releasing a Snyder Cut now doesn't make any sense. Itwould be a move that's counterproductive to the current upward trend that the DCEU is currently on. The studio had its first billion dollar film last year inJames Wan'sAquaman, andDavid F. Sandberg'sShazam! has earned early acclaim from criticsas the film is heading toward its opening weekend with reactions matching Patty Jenkins'Wonder Woman with a DCEU high Rotten Tomatoes score of 93% of this writing. Both films have demonstrated a marked departure from the tonality of the early Snyder-led DCEU films, and have found or seem destined to find success in doing so.","WithJustice League in its rear-view mirror, Warner Bros.is reportedly focusing more on self-contained films instead of an intricately plotted shared universe, and its easy to see why. The most successful films, both critically and commercially, within the DCEU have been standalone films, first with Wonder Womanand thenAquaman.Shazam! appears to be continuing that trend. There is, frankly, little incentive for the studio to look back when the future of its DC franchise is so much brighter than it ever has been.","Unfortunately for die-hard Snyder fans, this means the Snyder Cutwill likely never more than a pipe dream -- whether it exists or not.","Tags:\nfeature,\njustice league (film)","Leave A Comment","More in CBR Exclusives","WonderCon LIVE: The Cast of Archer Rockets Us To Archer: 1999","The OA Season 2 Gives Us An Even Better House on Haunted Hill","Marvel Rising: Heart of Iron Premieres at WonderCon LIVE","Remember When Captain Mar-Vell Had to Drink a Potion to Breathe on Earth?","Times That Superheroes Were Way Too Casual About Mindwiping People","When Thomas Wayne and Jor-El Teamed Up With Each Other!","Vegeta Ultra Instinct: Is It Possible?","The DC Extended Universe Timeline, From Wonder Woman to Shazam!","Baron Zemo Scrapes the Bottom of the Barrel to Form the Masters of Evil!","Major X #1 is Not the Nostalgia Trip Youre Looking for","The Immortal Hulk #16 Dives Deep Into the Series' Horrific Mystery","The Battle for Midgard Begins in War of the Realms #1, And It Is Glorious","G.

Because it's set in the '90s. And in case you weren't sure, it's absolutely full of '90s Easter eggs and references for you to relive some of that childhood nostalgia--or, if you're too young for that, a bunch of cool retro stuff to laugh about on the sheer weirdness factor alone.","Of course, Captain Marvel wasn't all throwbacks--though there were a bunch of them. Peppered amidst the clunky early internet tech, pay phones, and soundtrack full of earworms were some fantastic comic book nods that helped flesh out not only Carol Danvers' own personal story but the world of the Kree and Skrulls within the MCU. Captain Marvel carefully plucks bits of Carol's complicated, retcon-laden history out of the comics and repurposes them for the big screen, but don't panic, we carefully combed through every last detail that may have slipped by unnoticed.","Many of the small details in Captain Marvel reveal things about the MCU, including the present day Avengers Initiative and Nick Fury's backstory. With this movie strategically coming between two Avengers movies, it's also possible we've learned some important information for Avengers: Endgame.","While Endgame is sure to be an even bigger movie, Captain Marvel has been no slouch at the box office. In less than a month, its gross has nearly topped $1 billion worldwide and broken a variety of records. This is notable for a variety of reasons, including the fact that it's Marvel's first female-led superhero movie.","With Endgame's release approaching--it's in theaters on April 26--let's take a look at all the Easter eggs and references in Captain Marvel.","Share this Gallery","Latest Image Galleries","Avengers Endgame: 10 Things We Learned From Watching 10 Minutes Of Exclusive Footage","Apex Legends Guide: 12 Tips For Winning Gun Fights And Be A Better Teammate","Avengers Endgame New Trailer Breakdown: Cap And Tony Reunite And Everything Else","1. \"Thank You Stan\"","The typical MCU introduction has been completely overhauled as a thank you/in memoriam to Stan Lee, who passed away late last year. As a staple cameo in every MCU film to date, there couldn't have been a more fitting tribute. Check out our ranking of Stan's best MCU cameos for more.","2. The Last Blockbuster","Carol crash lands on Earth smack dab in the middle of a Blockbuster, 1990s America's favorite video store--you know, back when you had to actually leave the house to rent a movie, and there was about a 50/50 chance that the VHS you picked up would be damaged beyond repair or recorded over with someone's home movie, if they even had it in stock to begin with. What a time to be alive.","3. Remember True Lies?","The 1994 Arnold Schwarzenegger/Jamie Lee Curtis thriller has a nice little shout-out via a cardboard standee Carol blasts to pieces. Sorry, Arnold.","4. What about Hook?","Carol doesn't appreciate the fact that she walks right by a rentable copy of Hook, but we sure do. Honestly, it's high time for someone in the MCU to make a Rufio joke.","5. The Right Stuff","When Carol crash lands in the Blockbuster, the first VHS tape she picks up just so happens to be the 1983 classic The Right Stuff, a movie chronicling the first years of America's space program. Get it? Because Carol's from space? And also was a test pilot for the Air Force?","6. That Soundtrack","Captain Marvel's soundtrack is absolutely bursting with 1990s grunge and pop earworms, including:","\"Whatta Man\" by Salt 'N' Pepa feat. En Vogue","\"Only Happy When it Rains\" by Garbage","\"Waterfalls\" by TLC","\"Come As You Are\" by Nirvana","\"Just A Girl\" by No Doubt","\"Celebrity Skin\" by Hole","\"Man on the Moon\" by REM","(Also, there's a Smashing Pumpkins poster in the parking lot where Carol lands.)","7. Remember Mallrats?","Stan Lee's typical cameo as an in-universe character--usually a random old man who gets a single line in each MCU film--gets a nice twist in Captain Marvel, as Lee actually plays himself in this movie. You can tell, because he's reading a script for the 1995 Kevin Smith movie Mallrats, in which Lee also played himself.","8. Kelly Sue DeConnick on the subway","There's another comics creator cameo besides Stan Lee in Captain Marvel. In the subway station, Carol makes brief eye contact with a red-haired woman. If her appearance seems significant, it's because she's comics writer Kelly Sue DeConnick, who helped create the version of Carol Danvers' Captain Marvel we know today.","9. A world before Google","When Carol uses an ancient 1990s computer in her search for answers, she doesn't head to Google, like any sane 2019 person would. She uses AltaVista, an era-appropriate search engine that anyone who used the internet in the '90s probably remembers.","10. Street Fighter II","The dive bar in which Carol and Nick Fury pow-wow features a fun gaming Easter egg in the background: A Street Fighter II arcade cabinet. SF2 hit arcades in 1991, so it makes perfect sense that it would be glimpsed in somewhat dumpy bar in 1995.","11. Getting Grungey","The distinctly '90s look that Carol borrows from a mannequin after crash landing on Earth, including the signature Nine Inch Nails t-shirt, is called \"grunge.\" For you kids out there, grunge was popularized largely by Nirvana. By 1995, the style was already on its was to decline, though its influence can be seen today in ripped jeans and dirty flannels everywhere.","12. Nick Fury's history","Captain Marvel reveals plenty of potentially important details about Nick Fury's origins, including that he spent time as a spy before becoming an agent of SHIELD.","13. Fury's full name","The movie also reveals something that probably won't turn out to be important, but that we never knew before: Fury's middle name. His full name is Nicholas Joseph Fury. Now don't you feel like you know him a little bit better? Which is nice, because he's currently dust. :(","14. The origin of the pager","Avengers: Infinity War famously ended with an excellent Captain Marvel teaser, as Nick Fury sent a message on what looked like a modified relic of 1990s technology. In Captain Marvel, we learned the device's origins--and it turns out we were exactly right. It was a normal pager until Carol modified it and gave it to Fury in the event he should need to contact her across the wide depths of space.","15. Lawson is Mar-Vell","There was plenty of debate leading up to Captain Marvel's release about who would play Mar-Vell, a comics character with a long history. Was Jude Law's character really Mar-Vell? Who was actress Annette Bening playing? As it turned out, Law's character is actually a Kree named Yon-Rogg, and Bening played Dr. Lawson, who turned out to be the Kree Mar-Vell hiding in plain sight on Earth.","16. How I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air","Maria Rambeau's daughter Monica makes a fun reference to one of our favorite '90s TV shows: When trying to persuade her mother to embark on a dangerous mission with their old friend Carol, she mentions that the alternative is to sit on the couch watching Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. We know what we'd prefer.","17. It wouldn't be an MCU movie without an Infinity Stone","The MCU's favorite MacGuffin plays a surprise huge role in Captain Marvel. We had no idea going into the movie, but the Tesseract--ie the Space Stone--was the subject of Mar-Vell's research on Earth, and is the source of Carol's powers. No doubt this will be important in Avengers: Endgame--check out our full breakdown of the Tesseract's history and role for more.","18. A full view of Project Pegasus","Along with a lost chapter in the Tesseract's history comes a full look into Project Pegasus, the secret SHIELD initiative dedicated to studying the strange blue cube's powers. Previously, Pegasus had been referenced in comics and Easter eggs throughout the MCU, up to its destruction in the first Avengers movie.","19. Even more '90s (and earlier) nods","Captain Marvel's production design is exceptional. Everywhere you look--even on Mar-Vell's Kree ship that was hiding in orbit around Earth--there are relics of the '90s and earlier decades, from Troll dolls and pinball machines to the Space Invaders cabinet and even the Happy Days lunchbox that briefly holds the Tesseract. Fun stuff!","20. The NERF gun","This one was too good for us not to call it out specifically. When Minn-Erva and Carol finally face off, the Kree's opening salvo involves shooting our hero with what she likely believes is simply a garishly colored Earth weapon, with hopefully devastating properties. Instead, it's a beloved NERF gun that every '90s kid distinctly remembers losing every dart for and then letting it gather dust in your closet until your parents finally made you donate it to Goodwill.","21. The Rambeaus","Monica and Maria Rambeau are staples of Carol's comic book history, though normally she's the same age as Monica rather than Maria. As an adult, Monica even took over the mantle of Captain Marvel briefly before Carol did. Similar to Carol, Monica received her powers in a freak accident which exposed her to extra dimensional energy--so maybe with some luck we'll see an adult Monica Rambeau get her very own origin story in the MCU somewhere down the line.","22. \"Photon\" and \"Avenger\"","Carol's MCU callsign \"Avenger\" obviously played a major role in Fury naming the Avengers Initiative, but Maria's callsign \"Photon\" is actually a pretty deep cut comics reference. Maria's daughter, Monica, used the name Photon as her own superhero identity after she gave up being Captain Marvel in 1996.","23. The Supreme Intelligence","The Kree follow the will of an artificial intelligence known as the Supreme Intelligence which has taken a couple forms in the comics over the years, usually as some sort of giant head in a glass tube--not Annette Bening, so that's a new one. But the Intelligence itself, and all of its megalomaniacal Kree-first directives, are all straight from the source material.","24. Ronan and the Accusers","Guardians of the Galaxy fans will recognize blue Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser, the first major villain the Guardians faced off against. Ronan's not quite as unhinged here in 1995 but he's certainly still not a great dude--and he and his Accusers are more than ready to eliminate any threat to the Kree empire they perceive.","25. Carol's origin story","Carol's comic book origin story has been given a number of overhauls in the past, so the MCU's rendition of events doesn't quite follow any one particular plot to the letter, but it does prominently borrow from the first origin Carol received, when she was caught in the explosion of an experimental piece of tech called the \"psyche-magnetron\" which spliced her DNA with Mar-Vell's.","26. The credits scenes","It wouldn't be an MCU movie without the double post credits scenes. This time around we got a good look at just what Cap, Black Widow, Banner, and Rhodey have been up to since the Snap--and at Carol's arrival on Earth, as well as the rather unfortunate arrival of the Tesseract back on Earth after the Kree almost made off with it.","27. Captain Who?","Throughout the movie, no one ever utters the phrase \"Captain Marvel.\" It isn't printed in a newspaper headline by sensationalistic reporters, and the moniker isn't cooked up by a marketing team hoping to make money off Carol's heroics. Within the world of the MCU, Carol isn't actually called Captain Marvel, despite being a captain in the Air Force and the protege of the Kree Mar-Vell.

Data showed that whites produced an average of 680 kilograms of the CO2 each year, attributable to food and drink, whereas Latinx individuals produced 640 kilograms, and blacks 600.","They also found the diets of white people required 328,000 liters of water on average per year. Latinx used just 307,000 liters, and blacks 311,800. Both black and Latinx individuals used more land per capita with 1,770 and 1,710 square meters per year, respectively, than white people with just 1,550. Nevertheless, white people still made the greatest overall contribution to climate change.","While the difference may not be enormous, these numbers are per individual, and when you add up all those individuals, its very clear that whites are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of their food choices, says Bozeman.","Share this:","Share this article:","Share this:","Read Next","Woman gets preventive double mastectomy, learns DNA test w...","Read Next","Woman gets preventive double mastectomy, learns DNA test w...","Share Selection","Trending Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton NYPost.com","This story has been shared 8,434 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8,434","This story has been shared 7,467 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,467","This story has been shared 6,113 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6,113","Now On\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow on Page Six","SEE ALL","Video","Motorcyclist panics and painfully dumps his ride","Coupon Offers","14 Hotels.com coupons & coupon codes","$25 off $250+ with Hotels.com promo code","Viator promo codes & coupons","Save $44 on Grand Canyon national park VIP tour at Viator","65 Groupon discount codes","Free 2-month Subscription to ABCmouse at Groupon","8 Priceline coupons & promo codes","$160 off Orlando International Dr/Convention Ctr. at Priceline","Booking.com coupon & promo code","Booking.com's Easter deal: 25%+ off vacations in Asia","See All Coupons","More Stories","page six","'View' tell-all author says Rosie O'Donnell thought Whoopi was 'checked out'","nypost","Ocasio-Cortez slams critics for mocking her voice","Post Digital Network"," 2019 NYP Holdings, Inc.

Superman: Dawn of Justicecame to be.","RELATED:Justice League Photographer Casts Doubt on 'Snyder Cut'","\"The truth is that the 'Knightmare Sequence' in this movie, it was my idea that all of that would eventually be explained - is that a surprise?,\" the director said. \"And that we would end up in the distant future where Darkseid has taken over Earth, and where Superman has succumbed to the Anti-Life [Equation]. And there were a few members of the Justice League that survived to that world, and that they were fighting, Batman and a broken half of Cyborg - there's only half of him because of whatever happened - they were working on an equation to jump back to tell Bruce... those were the things that we were dealing with. And the studio, they were still sort of into the big look, but the deep depth about how and why everyone was mad at each other...\"","As Snyder continued, he revealed that the Flash's warning to Bruce Wayne about Lois Lane being the key was central to this future. \"Because Lois - and it's in the Justice League teaser; it wasn't in the movie apparently... it's this line where Bruce says, 'I was right here, and Barry Allen came to me and he said 'Lois Lane is the key.' And then [Wonder Woman] goes, 'She is to Superman; every heart has one.' And he goes, 'I think it's something more, something darker.' And what it means is that the thing that was darker was all about if Lois died, Superman would succumb to the Anti-Life, right? And Superman knew that somehow it was Bruce's responsibility to protect Lois, he would've been mad at him in this movie, and that's why he says, 'She was my world, and you took her from me.\"","But what, exactly, happened to the intrepid reporter? Well, according to Snyder, she would have fallen at the hands of the DC Universe's big bad. \"Because he [Bruce] had to jump back right before Darkseid Boom Tubes into the Batcave to murder Lois.\"","Of course, with Warner Bros. bringing in Joss Whedon to re-shoot and retool Justice League, the final film was far from Snyder's original vision. Since a Snyder Cut of the film is unlikely to ever be released, the director's answers may be all that fans will ever get to bring closure to this Batman v. Superman plot thread.","RELATED:Justice League Concept Art Reveals Unused Apokolips Creature","Next up for Warner Bros. is David F.

But as Thrillist reports, consumers shouldnt necessarily be so quick to label poultry products as a healthy food. Thanks to modern farming methods, some chicken sold in stores has more than three times the fat its supposed to, and this can be observed in the stripes of white tissue running through the meat.","White striping occurs when factory farmers breed birds to grow faster and larger, a practice Compassion in World Farming brought to light in a recent video. This can lead to adverse health effects for chickens, including muscular tissue disorders. Sometimes the disorders manifest in white lines that cut through the meat, creating a striped or wooden appearance.","The condition isnt just bad news for chickens. In 2013, scientists from the University of Bologna in Italy reported that chicken with white striping exceeded normal fat content by 224 percent. But that doesnt mean meat-eaters should drop poultry from their diets for good. Chicken still tends to have less cholesterol and saturated fat than red meat, and products with the muscular disorders are rare.","That being said, shoppers looking to cut extra fat from their meals should learn to spot white striping so they can avoid it at the supermarket. The photo below shows cases that range from normal to extreme.","You Know That White Stripe On Your Chicken Breast? Turns Out It's Bad, Very Very Bad https://t.co/PW2CLV3bLh pic.twitter.com/r7Rw8OlmPd"," Cass Anderson (@casspa) February 2, 2017","[h/t Thrillist]","If your aches and pains go beyond what a cuddling a microwavable plush sloth can soothe, a good heating pad is a must. But with dozens of brands to choose from at your local pharmacy and online, which one should you get?","After a recent trial run, the answer here at Mental Floss HQ is clear: the Sunbeam king-size moist/dry heating pad massively outperforms its $15 price tag. The giant heating pad gives high-end pain-relief gadgets (many of which we also love) a run for their money, with three different heat settings, a moist-heat option, and auto shut-off. Most importantly, it's bigat 11.7-inches-by-8.1-inches, it's made to stretch across your whole back, abdomen, or hips, meaning that it can target entire muscle groups at one time.","Sunbeam, Walmart","Though you can use it as a standard, dry heating pad, it also comes with a sponge insert that you wet for more penetrating heat. Studies have shown that heat therapy can help reduce muscle tension, increase circulation, and relieve pain in numerous different contexts, from chronic lower back pain to jaw pain [PDF] to muscle soreness from exercise. Some studies have also found that applying moist heat is more effective for pain relief (though others have noted no difference, although patients often prefer moist heat).","I bought the Sunbeam pad to soothe my chronic back and shoulder pain, and quickly found that I wasn't the only evangelist for the product. When I posted on Instagram about my new purchase, a friend immediately messaged me: \"using mine right now  and ohhhh it is so good.\" She was right. It's so good.","One more testament to its greatness? It's so popular that it recently sold out on Amazon. Luckily, you can still find it at Walmart or at one of the retailers belowbut grab it before it sells out there, too.","And yes, it's FSA eligible.","If youve ever found an extraneous nub of tissue protruding from your skinespecially around your neck, armpits, or groinyoure not alone. Known to doctors as acrochordons, skin tags are growths, most often found in the folds of your skin, like in your armpits. While it can be alarming to see any kind of growth on your skin, skin tags are completely harmless, and very common. According to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, they occur in as much as half the adult population. Heres what you should know about skin tagsincluding how to remove them.","What are skin tags, exactly?","Technically, a skin tag is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor made up of collagen fibers, capillaries, and lymphatic vessels. Theyre usually flesh colored, about the size of a grain of rice, and look like a little flap of skin connected to the body by a small stalk of tissue called a peduncle. While theyre most commonly found in the folds of your skin around your armpits, groin, neck, and sometimes eyelids, they can appear elsewhere on the body, too. They tend to affect middle-aged people more than young people, but they can happen to anyone.","What causes skin tags?","Scientists dont really know what causes skin tags. The friction of skin rubbing on skin may play a role, which would explain why they tend to form in the folds of your armpits and neck. There may be a genetic component, tooif your parents are prone to skin tags, you probably are as well. Recent studies have also linked a higher incidence of skin tags to conditions like obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance. Hormonal changes seem to play a role, too, since many women develop skin tags during pregnancy. Studies of biopsied skin tags have found that some low-risk forms of the human papilloma virus (HPV) are often present in the tissue. However, the tags themselves are harmless (and not contagious), and they don't need to be treated.","How do I get rid of a skin tag?","Just because skin tags are common doesnt mean they arent bothersome. If your skin tags irk you, either because they rub against clothing, or get caught in jewelry, or itch, or just because you dont like the way they look, you may want to have them removed. If you do want to get rid of them, you have a few different options.","First off, most dermatologists recommend getting your skin tags checked out by a professional. Its possible to misdiagnose them, and you dont want to ignore a more serious medical issue. Your doctor can confirm that your lesions are, in fact, skin tags, and that they arent a sign of something like insulin resistance.","From there, there are a few different ways to remove skin tags. A doctor might cut it off with a scalpel, freeze it with liquid nitrogen (much like they would a wart), or cauterize it with an electric device.","Can I get rid of a skin tag at home?","Since skin tags arent harmful to your health, health insurance plans typically dont cover removal services in a doctors office. Its considered a cosmetic procedure, unless the skin tag is particularly irritating or prone to bleeding, and can cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket.","So it's no surprise that people would rather remove their skin tags without visiting a medical facility. Many dermatologists strongly recommend having a licensed doctor remove your skin tags rather than trying to excise them at home, cautioning that improper removal can result in infection and scarring. But some medical authorities say it's OK to remove small tags at home.","The UKs NHS notes that if you have a small skin tag, it may be possible to remove it yourself with sterile (we repeat: sterile) scissors, though that seems like a pretty risky proposition to us. The health authority warns that you should never try to remove a large skin tag yourself because of the risk of bleeding. (Also, please do not attempt to remove a skin tag on your eyelids or other sensitive areas at home.)","Claritag, Walmart","There are a few at-home devices that are designed to be idiot-proof methods of removing skin tags. Mental Floss tested out Claritags squeeze and freeze skin tag removal device, which works very similarly to an at-home wart removal kit. Available from Walmart and Amazon for $50 for 10 treatments, the dermatologist-developed gadget is much cheaper than a visit to the doctor. The easy-to-set up, tweezer-like device encloses your hanging skin tag with foam pads soaked in a liquid cooling agent, freezing the extraneous tissue. The treatment itself takes only a few seconds, and is designed to remove your skin tag within two weeks. (It simply falls off as the area underneath it heals.)","Other devices, like TagBand ($12.50 on Amazon), use a rubber band to cut off the blood supply to the skin tag, achieving the same result: The skin tag dies and falls off within a week or so.","However, while some websites recommend using essential oils like tea tree oil to treat skin tags, theres no scientific evidence to show that those remedies work. That means you should probably stay away from the patch- and gel-based removal treatments that tout their natural ingredients.","If you have a large number of skin tags, have particularly large ones, or have them on your face, eyes, or groin, though, you're out of luckyou should go see a doctor to get them removed.","Mental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers and may receive a small percentage of any sale.

In a 2017 interview, the Sudbury native said that he didnt want to encourage this landscape of if you disagree with me politically, youre my enemy, and that he was giving Brady a pass because he gave me five rings.

The actor recently met with a number of politicians in Washington, D.C.; THR revealed that Evans was interviewing them for a new politics website that he co-founded, called A Starting Point, which aims to create informed, responsible and empathetic citizens.","You dont want to alienate half your audience, Evans said, regarding his political tweets.

It was later revealed that he faked some of his data, and Wakefield can no longer practice medicine, but his report is still fueling the anti-vaccination crowd, which maintains a link exists.","The Danish study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, specifically focused on criticisms from people who think vaccinations are dangerous. The researchers looked at children who have a sibling with autism and those with older parents, for example, to see whether some kids are more likely to be diagnosed with autism following an MMR vaccination, The Guardian reports.","Overall, the study followed 657,461 children, 6,517 of whom were diagnosed with autism over the decade-long study; 95 percent of the children received the MMR vaccine. The team found that children who were given the MMR vaccine were 7 percent less likely to develop autism than kids who did not get vaccinated, and that kids who did not receive any vaccinations were 17 percent more likely to be diagnosed with autism than kids who did get them.","They also determined that kids with autistic siblings were roughly seven times more likely to be diagnosed with autism than those who did not have that family connection. Dr. Anders Hviid of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, the study's lead author, made it clear that that vaccines should not be skipped due to fear of autism. \"The dangers of not vaccinating includes a resurgence in measles, which we are seeing signs of today in the form of outbreaks,\" he told Reuters.

Thirty-two percent of petless respondents also defined themselves as \"very happy.\"","Dog owners also lead cat owners in seeking comfort from their pet, playing with them and considering the animal a part of their family, although by a smaller margin than the happiness divide.","A 2016 study published in a multidisciplinary journal echoes this split, finding that people who self-described as \"dog people\" yielded higher levels of happiness and positive emotions than \"cat people.\" But a 2006 study from the Pew Research Center found no significant differences between dog, cat or non-pet owners, per the Post.","Some research suggests dog owners are more likely to make friends in their neighborhoods due to random encounters while walking their pets, reports the Post, thus increasing overall well-being.","Maybe if cats got out more, they wouldn't be stuck in the doghouse.

The two other Toledo-area pastors charged in the investigation have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.","Prosecutors said during the opening of Haynes' trial that he first had sex with the girl when she was 14. They said the evidence against him includes text messages, photos, voice mails and DNA evidence from his church where the girl said they often had sex.","Haynes' attorney told jurors that the allegations are shocking, but there's not enough evidence to prove the trafficking and conspiracy charges he faces.","Attorney Pete Wagner also said Haynes may have had a questionable relationship with the girl, but he didn't coordinate or take part in trafficking her to the other ministers. He also said there was no paying for sex.","Prosecutors say the girl had a difficult childhood and was sexually abused by a relative.","Haynes pledged in front of his congregation to protect her and serve as a father figure, but he began grooming her for sex when she turned 14 and first forced her to perform sex acts in front of him, said Michael Freeman, an assistant U.S. attorney.","They had sex day after day, often at a motel or his church, the Greater Life Christian Center in Toledo, and Haynes would give her cash, Freeman said.","After about a year, Haynes introduced her to Kenneth Butler, another pastor, and he also began having sex with her, Freeman said.","Sometimes, the two men joked about the arrangement, prosecutors said. One text shown in court that prosecutors say was sent by Butler to the girl said: \"You better be nice and naked when I get there.\"","Prosecutors said the girl next met Cordell Jenkins, a minister who founded his own church in Toledo and built a large following until it closed after his arrest.","The FBI has said in court documents that Jenkins had sex with two girls at his home, church office and a motel and often recorded the acts with his phone.","Haynes, prosecutors said, encouraged the relationship with Jenkins.","In addition to the charges against the men, Haynes' wife and stepdaughter are accused of abducting the girl at gunpoint in January and warning her not to testify at his trial.","Court documents say the pair forced the teenager from her apartment, choked her with a cord and told her to take back statements she made to investigators.

The Suns new Strip for Locals series is designed to highlight different destinations and attractions along Las Vegas Boulevard we think residents will enjoy just as much as tourists do.","After covering dining trends on and off the Strip for more than a decade, Ive definitely had more than my share of cheeseburgers. Ive eaten burgers crafted by celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Guy Fieri and been forced to judge In-N-Out against Shake Shack. Yes, its a tough job.","As great as Vegas burgers can be, my all-time favorite lives in Chicago. Conde Nast Traveler once wrote: Your quest for the worlds best cheeseburger ends at Au Cheval: This dimly lit, tightly packed, perfumed-by-beef-fat diner is perpetually jammed by crowds who descend for the gooey, double-patty revelations. That sums up my Au Cheval experiences and explains why I try to stop in every time I visit the Windy City; its griddled greatness is so popular that its parent company, Hogsalt Hospitality, has created a series of tiny burger joints, Small Cheval, all over Chicago. Ive happily devoured those burgers, too.","What does this have to do with Las Vegas food and Las Vegas locals? Thats where the Strip comes in. Perhaps youve visited Park MGMs sports bar and book, Moneyline, for a beer and a bite before a VGK game. Theres a little kitchen connected to Moneyline, the Side Betty Grill, serving up a simple menu of burgers, fried chicken sandwiches, nachos, wings, fries and a few other bar food selections.","But thats no ordinary sports bar burger. Hogsalt opened its first Las Vegas restaurant, Bavettes Steakhouse, at Park MGM in late 2017. Its a little known fact that the company also handles the food operations at Side Betty and that $10 griddled cheeseburger, served with dijonnaise, pickles and onions on a soft, slightly sweet bun, is the Vegas version of the Au Cheval/Small Cheval masterpiece. (Bavettes has a similar burger on its menu but its a fine dining destination with higher prices and a more formal atmosphere.)","So there are three questions that need answers. First, is it worth trekking to the Strip for an exemplary cheeseburger at a reasonable price? Thats something every local can decide on an individual basis, but for me, its a big yes. Is the Side Betty Grill going to become your go-to pre-game meal? Probably. And lastly, do I need to go to Chicago anymore?","The Side Betty Grill at Moneyline Sports Bar and Book at Park MGM is open Monday to Thursday from 4 to 10 p.m., Friday from 4 p.m. to midnight, Saturday from 9 a.m. to midnight and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.","Most Popular","Complete Listing ","Complete Listing ","Complete Listing ","Connect with Us","Scene in Las Vegas","Food: Behind the scenes at Bacchanal Buffet","Downtown: Great Vegas beer fest is back","Comedy: A conversation with Chris Tucker","Featured Galleries","DUI Strike TeamUpdate","The HuntridgeTheater","Saga Pastry andSandwich","More photos ","AP Headlines","Calendar","Penn & Teller","Penn & Teller Theater","Mystere","Treasure Island Theatre","V - The Ultimate Variety Show","V Theater inside Miracle Mile Shops","All events on Saturday ","Hozier","Pearl | 8 p.m. to 11:59 p.m.","The Bronx Wanderers","The Linq","Criss Angel MINDFREAK","Planet Hollywood","All events on Sunday ","Terry Fator: The Voice of Entertainment","The Mirage Hotel and Casino","Bunkhouse Karaoke","The Bunkhouse Saloon","Absinthe","Caesars Palace","All events on Monday ","Terry Fator: The Voice of Entertainment","The Mirage Hotel and Casino","The Bronx Wanderers","The Linq","Absinthe","Caesars Palace","All events on Tuesday ","Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life","Planet Hollywood","Magic Mike Live Las Vegas","Hard Rock Hotel & Casino","Sexxy","Westgate Las Vegas & Casino","All events on Wednesday "," Las Vegas Sun, 2019, All Rights Reserved"],"targetCaptions":[]}

I gave him a pitying look and said, It is an amazing album. Youll see. Youll see.","My husband is the reason we have a record player in the first place, and the only reason we have albums by the likes of Fleetwood Mac, Miles Davis, and the Beach Boys. At this point, my contributions to our vinyl collection had been 2Pacs All Eyes on Me and Rihannas Anti. My taste in music is pretty much either: What the cool kids were listening to back in middle school, or contemporary Top 40.","You see, I am exactly the kind of person who buys Jagged Little Pill on vinyl, and I am exactly the kind of person who buys records via Amazon Prime. (This Venn diagram overlaps completely.)","When that square-shaped Amazon package arrived one afternoon, I ripped it open and put it on immediately, feeling the thrill of nostalgic anticipation. This was more than two decades after I first listened to the album as a 12-year-old. Id purchased the CDat a Tower Records, no doubtafter seeing Alanis on MTV angrily stomping around in the desert for the You Oughta Know music video. I remember the shock of recognition at her long-ass tangly hair and spastic movements. She was a weird, dirty, uncontainable girl just like me.","Advertisement","That song channeled all of my simmering rageat dickhead little boys, at pubertys onslaught, and at the suffocating wave of feminine expectation about to wash right over me.","Needless to say, I was now, as I slipped the vinyl out of its sleeve, in a different era and life phase.  I had long ago made it through puberty (although my simmering rage atfeminine expectation continued). I was no longer listening on my beat-up Sony Discman, but rather a nostalgically reengineered record player. I had just picked up my toddler from daycare and was becoming the cliche parent imposing youthful cultural artifacts upon her offspring.","As soon as the trippy guitar and harmonica of All I Really Want kicked in, my toddler started dancing in stomping circles, and I felt briefly vindicated. See! You already like it, I exclaimed to this little human whose favorite song is Baby Shark. If I was honest, though, the bing-bing-bing of the electric guitar, the wobbly affectation of her voice, and the feeble lyrics (Enough about me, lets talk about you for a minute/Enough about you, lets talk about life for a while) had planted a seed ofdoubt.","Advertisement","Next was You Oughta Know, with itshalting, haunting opening: I. Want. You. To. Know. Im. Hap-py. For. You. When the electric guitar picked up and she wailed her, You, you, you oughta know-ohh, I cringed a little bit. What had once felt enlivening and validating now felt grating and corny. That electric guitar kept on clanging. Are electric guitars usually so... electric? I was finding it hard to think. Hard to be. Hard to exist. In the same room. As this music.","I turned down the volume. Then I checked the RPM on the record player, which my son often tweaks to humorous effect, but all was as it should be. AND YET IT WAS NOT. NOT AT ALL. Where was the album that I had loved so dearly and deeply?","When Perfect, a plain, earnest song about the pressure to be good enough, came on, I had a realization: Jagged Little Pill was Baby Shark for mid-90s angsty tween girls. It spoke in the simplest language, literally and musically, to that particular psychological stage of development at that particular cultural moment. She was every bit the flip-sides of tender earnestness and fuck-you anger that is so quintessentially middle school. The song begins alongside some light guitar: Sometimes is never quite enough/If youre flawless, then youll win my love/Dont forget to win first place/Dont forget to keep that smile on your face.","Advertisement","These are not profound lyrics. They are not timeless. But holy fuck did they speak to my sense of not being nearly good enoughaccording to boys, according to Seventeen, according to MTV spring break specials. Alanis was angry and unruly about not being good enough. She huffed real hard into her harmonica about it and filled me with You go girl feeling. The same was true with I See Right Through You. I saw right through-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh the bullshit, too! (Side-note, for another day: Can we talk about the lyrics, You took a long hard look at my ass and then played golf for a while?)","It wasnt even Ironic, and its infamous misuse of the word, that ultimately broke me. It was these lyrics: You live/You learn/You love/You learn/You cry/You learn/You lose/You learn/You bleed/You learn/You scream/You learn. I screamed. Oh did I. And then I texted my husband a mea culpa: Jagged Little Pill is actually Very Bad.","This feels like apostasy. Alanis has lived in my head for the past two decades as the artful embodiment of a powerful, unruly, inspiringly angry woman. The same year that I first listened to Jagged Little Pill, my dad took me to see her perform at the Greek Theater in Berkeley. We stood in the mosh pit, where plaid-wearing, twenty-something Cal students openly smoked pot, looking extremely impressed with themselves. Afterward, as the crowd poured out onto the street, Alaniss white limo went driving by and I ran after her, screaming, as she lifted a single hand through the moon roof and waved (right at me, I was pretty sure).","Advertisement","She was a statement of possibility for my 12-year-old self, and for many other girls and women at the time. The albums been called a powerful, DIY feminist statement. Some have asked whether its the most feminist album of the 90s. She was, as Allison Yarrow has argued, part of a crop of that eras women rockers, including Fiona Apple and Meredith Brooks, who represented a commercialization of Riot Grrrl rage. The nostalgia for Jagged Little Pill is such that its soon to become a Broadway musical. This makes both Alanis and the album, which she co-wrote and recorded at the young age of 19, culturally significantbut it doesnt make it good, timeless music.","And, needless to say, it doesnt mean buy it on vinyl.","Share This Story","Related Stories","The Jagged Little Pill Musical Written By Diablo Cody Is Heading to Broadway","Alanis Morissette's Ex-Manager Admits to Embezzling $4.8 Million From Her","Alanis MorissetteHad a Baby, Named Her Onyx Solace","About the author","Senior Staff Writer, Jezebel","You may also like","Civilian on Fly-Along Accidentally Ejected from Fighter Jet","Odd Tease In The Division 2 Spills The Beans On The Next Assassin's Creed","Say goodbye to sleep, AMC is showing all 22 Marvel movies in an insane 59-hour marathon","Recent from Tracy Clark-Flory","The #IMomSoHard Universe of Spanx, Wine, and Swimsuits","Florida Lawmaker to Sex Workers: They're Criminals, I Don't Need to Listen","'I Was Not Warned':Patients Push FDA to Ban Cancer-Linked Breast Implants"],"targetCaptions":[]}

I entered my March birth date, and instead of a plain confirmation, I was surprised by the message, Youre a Pisces! Do you like the ocean?","I do, in fact, love the ocean! I appreciated the personal touch, something you dont find from banks.","Plus, the companys commitment to do well and do good means it commits to donating 10% of its earnings to charity.","Where does that revenue come from if the services are free? All of Aspirations services work on a pay what is fair model. You choose your price and pay as a tip.","When you create an account, youll be prompted to choose your tip  a recurring payment up to $10 per month. You can choose as little as $0, and you can change it anytime.","How to Open an Aspiration Spend and Save Account","If this sounds good to you, too, you can get started with Aspiration here.","Start by entering your email address. The whole sign-up process takes less than five minutes.","Youll need your Social Security Number (you must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident to open this account) and your current bank account information to set up your opening deposit.","To open the account, youll need to make a one-time deposit of at least $10.","Youll answer some questions to verify your identity online, and if that works, youll be set. Based on my answers, the system was unable to verify my identity, so I had to complete an additional step.","I received an email the following day asking for primary and secondary I.D. I took a picture of my drivers license and obtained a PDF of a check stub. I resubmitted the application, and my account was approved and open within three days.","Tips for Using an Online Account","I havent left my old bank behind just yet, but my Aspiration account offers some nice perks that help me manage my money better. Here are the cool ways Ive found to use it:","Free ATMs","My favorite perk is the free ATMs! Users who travel, especially abroad, can transfer money into the account, so its available when you need it at no extra charge. Youll be reimbursed for ATMs from anywhere in the world within a few days.","Saving for Special Events","This seems like a great account to save for holiday shopping  but I prefer to use it as a travel fund.","I like to deposit payments from my freelance side gigs into my Aspiration account. Its helped me save for my flights home for the holidays!","Aspiration offers 2.00% APY on savings. Thats 25 times the average savings account interest rate of 0.08% reported by Bankrate  and at least 100 times what youll get with a typical checking account!","With no monthly fee and a minimum deposit of just $1 per month, this is an attractive option for saving small amounts.","Emergency Fund","In addition to saving for special events, this account can be a good place to keep an emergency fund.

Just enter an amount you want to give, and select one or more causes  poverty, water, education, etc.","This should make it easy to start contributing to causes that fight poverty.

They are:","These funds require only a $100 minimum investment, which opens up financial services that were traditionally only available to elite investors.","Should You Switch to Aspiration?","Ive been really impressed so far. Aspiration is a solid complement to my bank account, and one that helps me give back to a charity I care about.","I get the benefits of setting aside money into a high-yield account without paying a fee or worrying about keeping a minimum balance. And I get access to my cash anywhere I go without wasting money on ATM fees.","We may receive compensation from Aspiration for promoting the company, but we werent paid for this specific review.

Each of these characters has different abilities and outfits. While you can choose a different hero each match, many players choose to main one or two characters. So what does your preferred legend say about you as a person? Lets find out.","So Your Favorite Character Is Lifeline...","You are a good person. I dont know anything about you beyond the fact you read Kotaku. However, if you choose Lifeline in most matches I can confidently say you are a great human being. You like to help folks. You see someone struggling or in need and you jump into action.","Youre the person who wants to always help when something bad happens. Oh no! A man has fallen down the stairs! Dont worry, you are there and you are totally going to help. Or at least not laugh at the dude. Which is good of you too.","Advertisement","So Your Favorite Character Is Bloodhound...","Mysterious and quiet is your whole thing. You dont like to be the center of attention. No, instead you prefer to watch from afar. You are the type of player who never wears a headset. Pinging is what you prefer and you ping everything, especially if it relates to enemies.","Advertisement","You also love to observe situations. You are the person who your friends rely on when someone eats someone elses lunch at work. You look for clues, dig around the trash and eventually give up because you couldnt find anything. But you tried and that matters.","So Your Favorite Character Is Pathfinder...","You love to have fun! Life is a blast when you think about it. I mean, you have this awesome grapple hook, why wouldnt you be happy. While your teammates are climbing ladders and mantling up cliffs, you just zip up there and start pinging stuff they might want.","Advertisement","But you dont want to hog all the fun, you love to share some fun with your squad. Pop down a zip line and watch as your teammates fly down it towards your next loot location. You are the person who will willingly share the last slice of pizza or let a friend get another turn in GTA 3 after their last rampage ended quickly.","So Your Favorite Character Is Caustic...","Sometimes people suck. Sometimes you just wish you could be alone and never deal with another idiot. Like Caustic, you really wish you could place some poison traps while you are at work so that annoying dude doesnt come by your area AGAIN. You dont care about Game of Thrones, but does he care? Nope.","Advertisement","You also really like planning. Setting up a nice trap is what you love. You love waiting for teammates to lure some idiots into a room and then you run in and place some traps and cackle as you run back out. You could shoot them, but you rather let them suffer. You might be a bit messed up.","So Your Favorite Character Is Mirage...","You are quite the trickster. When others roll their eyes at a lame April Fools Day prank, you laugh. In fact, youve pulled off some great pranks before. Bamboozling is something you just love to do and you wont apologize for it.","Advertisement","You are a smooth operator too. You love to flirt and you dont care who knows it. Maybe you flirt too much? Nah. You flirt just the right amount, thank you very much. You also REALLY dig holograms, but most folks do.","So Your Favorite Character Is Bangalore...","Winning and killing are what you crave. You arent here to dig around every locker and box while searching for a perfect attachment. You are here to kill as many folks as you can. Give you a gun and you are ready to go.","Advertisement","You go to a party and win every hand of poker or at least most of them. Some might call you over aggressive or reckless, but this is a game about shooting people and winning, right? This is how Apex Legends is played. You ping when you can, but you know whats better than ping: A kill. And you want more kills.","So Your Favorite Character Is Gibraltar...","Look, winning isnt everything. It is nice, but you are here to have fun and meet some new friends. Come over here folks, you say. And hide in my bubble shield.","Advertisement","You know all the debate about hitboxes and how your main character is at a disadvantage in some ways compared to smaller ones. But whatever, youre here to have fun and help some folks out. You get along well with Lifelines.","So Your Favorite Character Is Wraith...","You gotta get moving. You always want to move. Never stop moving. Gotta go fast. You speed to loot and use teleporting to get ahead even faster. You help when you can, but if someone is moving too slow you leave them behind.","Advertisement","Other folks might hate you, but you dont care. Folks might call you overpowered or annoying, but they just need to get better.

We dont have a full understanding of how they form, but some may arise all on their own, without any clear influence from the surrounding terrain.","Generally, we assume that most waterfalls form because of the features of the landscape surrounding and beneath a river. For instance, an earthquake can shove land upwards along a tectonic fault to create a cliff face over which a river cascades, or a similarly steep drop could be created by glacier movement. Alternatively, the river could simply flow over a patch of particularly easily eroded rock and gradually create a waterfall as it eats its way down through the soft bedrock.","Joel Scheingross at the University of Nevada, Reno, and his colleagues found that waterfalls can actually form without any of those factors. A river flowing downhill over smooth and homogeneous ground can develop waterfalls all on its own.","Advertisement","This is difficult to study in nature because of the complexity of natural landscapes. Instead, the team tested it using a tilted, 7.3-metre-long artificial riverbed made of polyurethane foam to simulate bedrock. They poured water and small pebbles into the top of this flume to make a miniature river with sediment flowing down it.","The pebbles acted like tiny chisels, beginning to erode the foam riverbed almost immediately. Nature doesnt like things to be flat, says Scheingross. Some areas get eroded a little bit more and are a little bit deeper, and others stay a little bit shallower.","Read more: Volcanic eruptions have extreme effect on the flow of rivers","These small differences cause a feedback effect, in which pebbles flowing into the deeper areas hit the bottoms of the pools harder and create even steeper drops. Eventually, some of these steep drops become full-on waterfalls.","We often use waterfalls as proof of past climate and tectonic changes  for example, to say that a glacier carved the ground so conditions must have been cold. Self-forming waterfalls could be a problem for those assumptions.","If it turns out, as my hunch is, that these types of waterfalls are ubiquitous, then I think it will change how weve interpreted some past changes in climate and tectonics, says Scheingross. First, though,well have to find self-forming waterfalls in the wild.","Journal reference: Nature, DOI: 10.1038/s41586-019-0991-z","More on these topics:","Advertisement","Magazine issue\n                                    \n                                        3222\n                                    \n                                    , published 23 March 2019","Previous article","Secretive new frog species from ancient lineage discovered in India","Next article","Home DNA-testing firm will let users block FBI access to their data","Advertisement","Sign up to our newsletter","Get the app","FOLLOW US"],"targetCaptions":[]}

Names such as Idris Elba and Richard Madden continue to be rumored, although some actors such as Elizabeth Banks and Gillian Anderson have proposed gender-flipping the character and introducing the worlds first female Bond. Eva Green, a 007 icon having played Vesper Lynd in Craigs first Bond movie Casino Royale, believes wherever Bond goes next the character should remain played by a man.","Im for women, but I really think James Bond should remain a man, Green told Vanity Fair on the Dumbo red carpet. It doesnt make sense for him to be a woman.Women can play different types of characters, be in action movies, and be superheroes, but James Bond should always be a man and not be Jane Bond. There is history with the character that should continue. He should be played by a man.","Greens opinion is similar to that of Rachel Weisz, who gained attention in February 2018 for saying women should create their own action movie opportunities instead of settling for playing a pre-existing character. As Weisz said,[Ian Fleming] devoted an awful lot of time to writing this particular character, who is particularly male and relates in a particular way to women. Why not create your own story rather than jumping on to the shoulders and being compared to all those other male predecessors? Women are really fascinating and interesting and should get their own stories.","Eva Green and Daniel Craig, Casino Royale","Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock","Greens role as Vesper was acclaimed when Casino Royale opened in 2006 and the character is widely viewed as one of the best and most progressive Bond girls in the history of 007 movies. The actress told Vanity Fair she is proud to be the central figure in evolving the Bond girl to be more than just a good-looking sidekick.","I originally had reservations about being a Bond girl. I didnt want to be a bimbo, Green said. The women are now perceived differently. They are intelligent and sassy and fascinating. I loved playing Vesper. Shes the only one to get to Bonds heart and has a big impact on his life.","Green can rest easy about Bond staying male, as 007 movie producer Barbara Broccoli has been outspoken about not flipping the characters gender.Bond is male, Broccoli said last year. Hes a male character. He was written as a male and I think hell probably stay as a male.","Bond 25 will be Craigs fifth outing as 007 following Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, and Spectre. Green had nothing but praise to share for her former co-star, hailing him as the best James Bond weve ever seen.","Hes made James Bond human, Green said. We see him flawed and vulnerable.","Craigs final outing as James Bond will open in theaters April 8, 2020. Green can next be seen in Tim Burtons Dumbo, opening nationwide from Disney on March 29.","Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

Not as Much as You Think","targetDescription":"There was a time, not all that long ago, when every team in the  NBA  would have done anything to acquire  LeBron James .    Not now...","targetKeywords":"","targetParagraphs":["There was a time, not all that long ago, when every team in the NBA would have done anything to acquire LeBron James.","Not now.","Nothing captures just how much damage this season has done to a player some still consider the league's best than the reaction to the idea of trading for himunless it's the reaction to the idea of his team, the Los Angeles Lakers, swapping him. No spit takes. No foreheads smacked. No questions about anyone's soundness of mind. Maybe the parade of shocking moves across the league in recent years has made \"never say never\" a wise mantra. Maybe the Lakers' downward spiral in the season's second half has made the unthinkable thinkable. Rest assured, no matter the reason, the idea of trading James has been contemplated in NBA front offices as well as on talk shows.","\"Hmmm,\" pondered one Eastern Conference owner when asked if his team would trade for James if given the chance. \"At this point, probably not, given where we are. I wouldn't want to gut the team for a player that isn't committed and is toward the end of his career.\"","A Western Conference owner said he would consider dealing for James but with conditions. \"Depends on what I'd have to give up,\" he said. \"I wouldn't roll up the truck and give more than one protectedfirst[-round pick].\"","To be clear, the Lakers have given no indication that they are considering what former NBA coach and current ESPN broadcaster Jeff Van Gundy is credited with first publicly suggesting: that to rebound from what looks to be a sixth consecutive losing season and sixth straight trip to the lottery despite James' addition last summer, the Lakers should \"explore\" trading the four-time MVP. While the Lakers advertised his arrival as only the first step toward building another title contender, oddsmakers had them comfortably making the playoffs with a 13- or 14-win jumpfrom last season's 35. Instead, they are 31-36 and 6.5 games out of the last playoff spot in the Western Conference with 15 contests left. At their current pace, James' addition will result in a three-win improvement.","The subject of moving James, however, was contemplated by the Lakers, a team source said, weeks before Van Gundy aired it. When rumors engulfed the team at the February trade deadline that it was willing to trade anyone other than James to acquire All-Star forward Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans, James' agent, Rich Paul, was widely accused of spreading those rumors because Davis is also one of his clients. Paul denied to B/R that he leaked the Lakers' interest in Davis, but Buss suspected otherwise and was furious. The idea of terminating the franchise's relationship with Paul by moving James at least crossed Buss' mind, the team source said, and Paul was made aware of that. That prompted Paul to reach out to Buss to clear the air, and whatever ill will existed supposedly dissipated. At the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference a few weeks later, Buss blamed the media for making the rumors public.","One Western Conference GM said he would be interested in trading for James to contend with the defending champion Golden State Warriors, but he wouldn't swap his best player for him because it would defeat the purpose. Translation: James can't single-handedly lead a team to title contention, especially in the Western Conference. He needs a fellow star next to him, along with the right coach and supporting cast.","\"He's not good enough anymore to take four cadavers and get to the Finals,\" the GM says. \"Not in the West.\"","James does not have a no-trade clause in the four-year, $153.3 million contract he signed last summer, league sources say, but he does have a 15 percent trade kickerhis contract's value increases 15 percent and the raise has to be accounted for in making the deal work under salary-cap ruleswhich complicates, but does not preclude, moving him.","\"I still think you could get a decent package for him from a bad team,\" one Western Conference assistant GM says. \"A first-round pick and a good young player. But it would've been a lot more a year ago, for sure.\"","One former GM questions if the Lakers could afford the fallout of trading James even if they received a superstar in return. \"Even if it's the right thing to do as a franchise, I don't know how you'd do it,\" he says. \"LeBron would eviscerate them. The question goes beyond what you could get for him to: How do you explain that away? How do you go to the next free agent and say, 'We really want you,' and have him believe you after you had the face of the league for six months and then traded him away?\"","Several league executives would not be surprised if the Lakers at least explored their options. One Eastern Conference vice president of basketball operations wondered if the Milwaukee Bucks, in their effort to keep superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, would consider pairing him with James. Another suggested the Boston Celtics could offer a combination of young talent and draft picks and still have the requisite talent to contend, but that would require Buss and her team president and Lakers legend, Magic Johnson, to put aside a decadeslong rivalry with the Boston franchise, which is hard to imagine.","There's also the intracity rivalry with the Clippers to consider. The prospect of seeing them with the biggest star in town would be hard to stomach. \"They can't sit in that market, egowise, and see either LeBron playing for the Clippers or see the Clippers get Kawhi with LeBron someplace else,\" the Western Conference GM says. \"They sell 'star' like no one else.\"","This, by the way, is not a place most teams expected the Lakers to be.The owner who wouldn't deal for James now would have a year ago. \"If we could have traded for him and knew he would sign long term, it would be hard not to do it,\" he says. \"He took his team to eight straight Finals!\"","The Western Conference GM speculates that more owners than executives see value in James at this point, largely because the latter have seen how their colleagues' jobs have entailed catering to James and dealing with Paul, who is not popular with more than a few front offices. \"Even if you're solid in your job, you know that anywhere LeBron goes you're suddenly under the gun,\" he says. \"Your only choice is to give him the keys and let him run it. And even if you didn't want that, your owner might. Because he doesn't have to deal with what comes with it.\"","The element that has done the most to lower James' value this season is not another example of the turmoil and hyper-scrutiny he seems to bring to every teamalong with, at least in the past, unprecedented successbut the groin injury that forced him to miss 17 games and some have suggested is still impacting his play. The suspicion is that, at 34 and already holding the record for most playoff minutes and ranking 15th all-time in regular-season minutes, James is finally succumbing to Father Time.","\"The injury changed things more than anything else,\" the Western Conference owner says.","For now, the expectation is the Lakers will look for James to get healthy and during the offseason acquire the kind of high-IQ role players, veterans and outside shooting that have provided the template for James' success elsewhere.","\"I don't see him being able to raise a bunch of young pups,\" the Eastern Conference VP says. \"It's going to be all about familiarity with LeBron. They'll ask him, 'What it's going to take?'He will say, 'This, this and this,' and they'll get the band back together.","\"The wild card is Jeanie Buss. She could...ask LeBron, 'If you're not with all this, tell us where you want us to send you and we'll make it happen.'\"","Ric Bucher covers the NBA for Bleacher Report.

I was at the game and have video of @bryceharper3 striking out and theres are no boos.","Im confused. Players themselves heard the boos. Im sure there were a ton of Braves fans there, Rhys Hoskins said.","The fans booed when the umpire called timeout before the pitch. When he struck out there were plenty of audible sighs. I was on the third baseline at the game.","I thought you didn't hear any boos.","I didnt like I said. Where did I say I heard boos?","You went from saying you didn't hear any boos at all to saying you heard them after the first pitch. The goalposts keep moving. None of this changes the fact that people--not all, but plenty--booed him after he struck out the second time. I agree this isn't a big deal.","I said I didnt hear any boos when he struck out.

She lacks the ability to show compassion or empathy, she has no soul.","Shes working for the same party that believes you shouldnt abort foetuses but they dont want to provide health care, education or recreational activities for children with disabilities.

The political motivations are clear. The new state  for which they propose the unwieldy name State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth  would be reliably Democratic, adding two senators and one representative to the partys totals.","There are plenty of reasons to oppose this precise solution, but the issue of taxpaying Americans not having a representative voice in Congress is not easily dismissed. And if Congress wants to address that issue, Puerto Rico, not the District of Columbia, should become our 51st state.","Republicans have reason to support such a move along with Democrats. The GOP party platform has favored Puerto Rican statehood for decades, but Republicans have remained wary of acting on the issue, convinced that Puerto Rico, like D.C., would be a reliably blue state. Thats not exactly true. Puerto Rico had a Republican-affiliated governor as recently as 2013, and its current nonvoting delegate to Congress, Jenniffer Gonzlez-Coln, is a Republican. If Puerto Rico became a state, it is reasonable to believe that Gonzlez-Coln or another Republican would take one of the islands two seats in the Senate.","Puerto Rican statehood, besides being the right thing to do on the merits, would also enhance the nations appreciation of federalism and further entrench the conservative value of local control. Puerto Rico differs in significant ways from the rest of the United States, but this should be seen as an asset, not a liability. Admitting it to the union would increase diversity among the states, forcing us to question whether one-size-fits-all federal laws are the best way to govern an increasingly varied people.","Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony from its discovery by Christopher Columbus in 1493 until Spain ceded it to the United States after the Spanish-American War in 1899. Other parts of the United States were once Spanish colonies, including Florida and the entire Southwest.","Those lands were sparsely populated, though, which meant that an influx of English-speaking Americans overwhelmed the existing Spanish and Native American populations, making them demographically similar to the rest of the country relatively quickly.","This was not the case in Puerto Rico. The islands population at annexation was nearly 1 million, and while some English-speaking people moved to the new colony, they were always a minority. (Even today, roughly 95 percent of Puerto Rico residents speak Spanish as their primary language.) There were religious differences at annexation, too, as the island was majority-Catholic while the rest of the United States was overwhelmingly Protestant, despite several decades of heavy immigration from Catholic countries in Europe.","These differences may have accounted, along with then-prevailing racial prejudices, for the ambiguous status of Puerto Rico within the American nation. In 1917, Congress extended American citizenship to anyone born on the island after 1898. In doing so, it recognized that the island was a permanent part of America, while also conveniently allowing draft-age men there to be conscripted as the nation entered the First World War.","Under a constitution adopted in 1952, Puerto Rico chose to continue the ambiguous status quo. In that document, the island is called a commonwealth, and the term has come to signify the relationship that exists between Puerto Rico and the federal government  a free, associated state whose people are Americans but lack some of the political rights of Americans who live in the 50 states. After five referendums with varying wording and results, that relationship continues to this day.","In 2017, Puerto Rican voters chose statehood in a referendum on the islands status. It was the fifth referendum in the past 50 years, but, owing perhaps to its low-turnout or perhaps to Congresss reluctance, no offer of statehood was extended by the federal government, nor did the Puerto Rican government formally request a change in status from free association to full membership in the American union.","That leaves the exact legal status of Puerto Rico in limbo, but the island and its residents are without a doubt a part of America. Puerto Ricans are Americans. They serve in our military and contribute to our nation. Yet they lack the voting rights that Americans in the 50 states take for granted. Statehood would rectify that problem, integrating Puerto Rico more closely into the nation of which it is already a part.","These points have all been made before by statehood advocates, and they alone would justify granting statehood to Puerto Rico. What is often unsaid is that making Puerto Rico the 51st state would also be good for the rest of America in one specific way: It would remind us why we are a federal republic.","Modern advocates of unitary government like to say that states are meaningless nowadays, that the differences between them are so minute that there is no point in honoring them. This was not the attitude of the Founding Fathers, many of whom found even the limited central government imposed by the Constitution to be threatening to the local distinctions between what had originally been separate colonies.","It seems trivial to point out now, but there were serious cultural differences among the 13 colonies even when all were majority-Protestant and majority-English. Puritan Massachusetts, Quaker Pennsylvania, and Anglican South Carolina did not view themselves as the same. Sizable ethnic (the Dutch in New York, the Germans in Pennsylvania) and religious (the Catholics in Maryland) minorities added to colonial diversity. Federalism, though primarily a political measure, also worked to preserve these unique subcultures of early America.","As the nation grew, the states became more diverse. Louisiana was a French colony when the United States acquired it in 1803, and that distinctive colonial heritage still flavors the culture and the law there today. The Southwest, as already mentioned, was historically Spanish, and Hawaii had a long history as an independent kingdom before being annexed by the United States in 1898. Although our nations cultural differences are less acute than they once were, thanks to internal migration and homogenized mass media, the states still vary from one another. Federalism helps maintain that variation within a united republic.","Federalism would help preserve Puerto Ricos culture even as the island would become more deeply integrated with the rest of America. Indeed, Puerto Ricos representatives in Congress would probably call for guarantees of federalism to make sure of that. Although many in the Republican party believe that the island would be thoroughly Democratic as a state, Puerto Rican politicians would not be keen on the national Democratic partys penchant for consolidating power in Washington, D.C.","To see how federalism would look if Puerto Rico were admitted as a state, we need only examine our neighbor to the north, Canada.","In most respects, Canadians are just like Americans: a majority-English-speaking, majority-Protestant people living in a collection of former British colonies. The exception to the rule is Quebec. When Canada began the gradual process of securing independence from the United Kingdom, federalism was seen as the only way to unite the English-speaking Protestant provinces with the French-speaking Catholic one. And while the differences between Catholic and Protestant are less important to most people nowadays, the differences between French- and English-speaking Canadians remain and have helped preserve the federal nature of Canadas union when other centralizing, progressive trends in Canadian politics might have destroyed it.","Even when Canadas government is to the left of ours, federalism is maintained, with foreign affairs and economic policy mostly handled in Ottawa and cultural and educational matters dealt with at the provincial level. We think of Canada and the U.K. as both having socialized health care, and thats true. But the two systems are not managed the same way. Britains National Health Service is the sort of top-down model that conservatives in this country fear; Canadas model is managed by the provinces, not unlike our Medicare system. Both systems would probably entail too much government intrusion for most Americans, but the Canadian version offers more local control, and works better, than Britains.","Changes in Canadian governance over the years have involved negotiations between the provinces and the federal government. Disputes over federalism led to conventions between provinces, not just debates in the federal legislature. In the Meech Lake Accord in 1987 and the Charlottetown Accord in 1992, these compromises failed, but even failure in such a scenario is better than huge top-down reforms rammed through without regard for local concerns.","A more diverse conglomeration of states would likely lead to similar demands for more local autonomy, which could not come at a better time. The United States government has grown too big and centralized to be controlled by a single executive. Greater variation in geography, size, and culture among the states would force us to appreciate anew the need for federalism and might even lead to a more clearly defined division of powers between the different sovereignties, as found in Part VI of Canadas 1867 constitution.","A century of drift away from the American Constitutions vital federalist principles has left them ripe for rediscovery and renewal. Adding a new state to the Union, especially one already accustomed to remaining culturally distinct within the American nation, would spur that process forward. Congress should admit Puerto Rico as a state, and Americans as a whole should embrace the differences within our nation and the federal structure that allows them to coexist in peace.","More in Politics & Policy","A Gas Tax Would Turn Trump into President Donald Macron","Court Ruling Implies That Barr Must Redact Grand-Jury Info from Mueller Report","How Theresa May Can Get a Better Brexit Deal  and How Trump Can Help","What the Electoral College Saves Us From","Top Stories","NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.","Photo Essays","Grand National Festival","Top Shots","USS Wasp","Recommended Articles","Most Popular","A Big Win for Conservatives in Wisconsin?","In Wisconsin, a Vote against Anti-Christian Bigotry","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Says Bartending Helped Her Recognize Cohens Lies","The Underexamined Factor in Too Many Police Shootings","House Dems Request Trumps Personal and Business Tax Returns, Setting Up Legal Battle","Chasing Bonnie and Clyde","The Supreme Courts Absurd Death-Penalty Debate","Conservatives Shouldnt Use Transgender Pronouns","Around the Web","Does Joe Biden Have No Shame?","How Rachel Maddow Turned Into Infowars","U.S. Jobs Grew by 196,000 in March","Why Europe Is Getting Tough on China"," 2019 National Review","Newsletters"," 2019 National Review"],"targetCaptions":[]}

In the video above, GameSpot video producer Jean-Luc Seipke and associate editor Jordan Rame voice their impressions of the trailer after watching it.","Fans of the original Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, and Tales from the Borderlands: A Telltale Series, both Jean-Luc and Jordan are happy to see several beloved characters return in the trailer for the new game. Most notable is an adult Tiny Tina, who was still 13-years-old in Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, but the return of characters from Tales from the Borderlands is a welcome surprise. There are plenty of other familiar faces as well, such as Sirens Lilith and Maya (the latter of whom is now sporting longer hair), Ellie, Marcus, and Sir Hammerlock.","Although the sight of so many beloved Borderlands characters is nice, both Jean-Luc and Jordan are wary of just how little the Borderlands 3 trailer touches on the franchise's strongest points. The characters' hilariously ludicrous dialogue is absent, and there's little individuality in regards to the new heroes and villains. Jean-Luc and Jordan are also a little worried that the environments in the trailer all look a little too much like Pandora. If Borderlands 3 takes place on multiple worlds--as Borderlands 2 implied and the new trailer claims--then the people and places in this new game should be fairly different from what's been seen before.","Obviously, with this being the very first look at Borderlands 3, neither Jean-Luc or Jordan are ready to condemn or praise the game--especially not before they can get their hands on it. As is, after watching this trailer, they are optimistic Borderlands 3 can carve out its own identity in the now loot shooter heavy market.","Borderlands 3's announcement was accompanied by the reveal of an enhanced Borderlands GOTY Edition coming to Xbox One, PS4, and PC. A free update is also being released that adds 4K graphics to Borderlands: The Handsome Collection--a bundle of Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel--which is also available on Xbox One, PS4, and PC.","Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

But you may not know quite how networks function, thus enter our modem versus router comparison.","Both are necessary components for wired and wireless internet access in your home. Understanding the difference between the two can help you diagnose and possibly fix networking problems before placing time-consuming calls with technical support.","We provide an explanation of each and illustrate how and why each device is important. We also explain a new alternative to using the standard router if youre considering an upgrade to your current home network setup.","Modem","The modem is your on-ramp to the world wide web. Once the internet grew to become a mainstream household product in the early 1990s, modems became add-in cards for desktops and USB adapters for laptops. Cable-based broadband producing speeds faster than 56Kbps seeminglyreintroduced the external modem at the beginning of the century, thus here we are today.","Right now, Xfinity from Comcast is the largest cable provider in the United States, covering 40 states. That is followed by Charter Spectrum, covering 43 states. These broadband providers rent modems as part of their subscription plans so you can access their subscription-based service. But you can purchase compatible modems separately from any retailer to cut down on the monthly cost. Either way, youll need one to access the internet.","How it works","Modems usually include lights/LEDs along their front, so you can see whats going on at a glance. One light indicates that the unit is receiving power, one signals that its receiving data from your internet service provider and one shows that the modem is successfully sending data. This is where you start in a troubleshooting scenario: If the send and/or receive lights are blinking, then your internet service provider is likely having issues or something is going on with the connection outside. Another LED is provided indicating that wired devices are accessing the internet.","Before we move on, note that modems arent just for a coaxial cable connection. Broadband can be served up through a Digital Subscriber Line too, or DSL. This internet on-ramp is accessed through telephone lines instead of coaxial cables, so the connecting jack looks no different than what you would see on physical, land-based phones. DSL is typically slower than cable-based broadband and useful in rural areas where phone lines already exist, but theres no infrastructure supporting cable-based TV and internet services.","Whether the router is designed for DSL or cable-based broadband, the four Ethernet ports are used for wired devices with a matching port or adapter. These can include desktops, laptops, HDTVs, gaming consoles, printers, and more. If you want the most out of your broadband connection, using these ports for your hardware is the best option, especially if the ports support speeds of up to one gigabit per second (aka gigabit Ethernet).","Router","But not everyone wants to lineEthernet cables all over their house, and thats where the router comes in. Its a stand-alone device that connects to an Ethernet port on the modem, and routes networking/internet traffic to its connected devices. Routers typically have a dedicated, color-coded Ethernet port thatit uses to physically connect to the router (WAN, or Wide Area Network), and four additional Ethernet ports for wired devices (LAN or Local Area Network).","Thus, the router sends and receives networking traffic from the modem with one connection, and routes all that data through its four Ethernet ports, and through the air via the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Despite advertised numbers, wired is faster than wireless, and we still suggest using Ethernet if you want every ounce of bandwidth out of your subscription. But obviously you cant do that with smartphones, and draping Ethernet cables along every wall is just downright ugly.","Unfortunately, routers come in all sizes, prices, and exaggerated promises. On the wireless side, they can include two external antennas or more, depending on the model. The more antennas they have protruding in the air like a dead spiders legs, the higher the prices will soar. Of course, the added antennas mean increased range, but your connection speed will depend on your proximity to the router, and the technology powering that connection.","The current wireless standard is Wireless AC. Its first implementation enables three outgoing streams and three incoming streams (33) on the 5GHz band at up to 433Mbps each. Theyre accompanied by three incoming and three outgoing Wireless N streams (33) on the 2.4GHz band at 200Mbps each. The latest update to the Wireless AC specification, aka Wave-2, adds a fourth stream for additional bandwidth. Problem is, smartphones typically only support between one (11) or two (22) incoming/outgoing streams, so they cant get the full benefits of routers supporting 33 broadcasts.","How it works","If all of this is confusing, just imagine a high-speed train. It enters your home through the modem, travels to the train station (router) at full speed, and is redirected to a destination. If the destination is a wired connection, then it plows full speed ahead. If the destination is wireless, its speed is based on how many tracks/streams it can use at once (one, two, three, or four), the amount of congestion these tracks must penetrate, and the distance between the train station and the destination. The train will lose speed the further it travels away from the station.","The up to term means the hardware is physically capable of supporting those maximum speeds, but again you wont see them. Part of the congestion slowing your local data train is your neighbors network spreading the love in the same airspace. Theres also interference from devices within and outside your home. Having a router with multiple, external antennas with amplifiers will help push back all that unwanted noise.","Typically, routers will choose the ideal channel for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands that have the least interference. The 2.4GHz band is divided into 14 channels while more than 20 are set aside for the 5GHz band. But if youre having connectivity issues, manually changing the channels within the routers web-based interface can sometimes help. Theres a lot more at play regarding speed that gets into the heavy technical territory and can make your head spin.","Check out our list of the best wireless routersyou can buy right now.

Us, his superbly oblique horror follow-up to Get Out, is a massive success, his Twilight Zone reboot premieres next week, and the guy still has a shit-ton of Nazi-hunting shows and Lovecraft County adaptations and unofficial Key & Peele reunions in the pipeline. Peele has already cemented his place as one of the greatest and most prolific filmmakers in the business, and it sounds like he's going to keep using his growing fame to push Hollywood in a better directionby refusing to make movies starring yet another white dude.","\"I feel fortunate to be in this position where I can say to Universal, 'I want to make a $20 million horror movie with a black family.' And they say yes,\" Peele said during a Q&A in Los Angeles on Monday, according to the Hollywood Reporter.","\"I dont see myself casting a white dude as the lead in my movie. Not that I dont like white dudesbut I've seen that movie.\"","\"It really is one of the best, greatest pieces of this story, is feeling like we are in this time,\" Peele went on, as the audience reportedly cheered. \"A renaissance has happened and proved the myths about representation in the industry are false.\"","During the conversation, Peele also spoke about his long path to success, starting with a stint at MadTV and a missed opportunity to join the SNL cast, which apparently led to a stretch of time he spent getting blazed in his room and scheming \"like a comic book supervillain.\" Eventually, those schemes turned into a shit-ton of screenplaysone of which wound up becoming Get Out.","\"Every two weeks I'd go, 'What the fuck am I doing? I'm writing a movie where a black man is victimized and all the white people are evil and I'm trying to get the audience to have fun,'\" Peele said of Get Out. \"But if you could make that fun that's what brought me back.\"","Peele didn't tease any new projects during the chat, but whatever else he's got cooking, it's safe to say it won't put another Extremely Successful White Male in the spotlight. Apologies to everyone dreaming of an Us spinoff starring Tim Heidecker or whatever. In any case, let's hope Peele pens Lupita Nyong'o another star vehicle sometime soonher turn as Adelaide and Red in Us better earn her both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars, for the freaky dancing alone.","Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.","Newsletters are the new newsletters.","Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily."],"targetCaptions":[]}

Peppers is not a suspect in the homicide, police say.","5 On Your Side Investigators learned Tuesday that CPD turned over two different reports to the NFL last week.","The first report is from Jan. 29 and is regarding an incident involving a stolen gun belonging to Peppers.","The report states that someone went into a parking garage on East 12th Street, broke into Peppers 2014 Range Rover and took a bag with his jersey number on it, sunglasses and an iPad. The report also states that a Glock semi-automatic handgun was taken from the center console.","According to the report, a 57-year-old woman named Marsha Carroll was listed as a possible suspect.

Snyder's Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice was a commercial success but not exactly a hit with critics, while Justice League failed on almost every level. Snyder left Justice League during post-production and the DC universe bounced back with the hugely successful Aquaman. But although Snyder is no longer involved with DC, he still has some opinions about the films he made.","At a recent Q&A session with the director after a screening of his 2009 film Watchmen, Snyder was asked about the dark tone that his DC movies had, and how fans had an issue with that fact both Batman and Superman kill people in them. As the footage posted to reddit revealed, the director didn't have much sympathy for their point of view.","\"Someone says to me: Batman killed a guy. I'm like, 'F***, really? Wake the f*ck up',\" he said. \"Once you've lost your virginity to this f***ing movie and then you come and say to me something about like 'my superhero wouldn't do that.' I'm like 'Are you serious?' I'm like down the fucking road on that.\"","\"It's a cool point of view to be like 'my heroes are still innocent. My heroes didn't f***ing lie to America. My heroes didn't embezzle money from their corporations. My heroes didn't commit any atrocities.' That's cool. But you're living in a f***ing dream world.\"","Of course, there's still plenty to come from the DC movie universe. Next month sees the release of the more comedic Shazam. In his review, GameSpot's Michael Rougeau said that the film \"is the first DC movie that seems genuinely confident in its world and tone, with no major missteps of which to speak. It's fun, heartfelt, funny, genuine, and surprising, while staying true to its origins and embracing what makes it great.\"","Beyond that, the much anticipated Joker origin movie arrives in October, with Joaquin Phoenix starring as the Clown Prince of Crime. The female superhero team-up Birds of Prey is released in February 2020, and Wonder Woman 1984 follows in July next year. Beyond that there are also 2021 release dates for the standalone Batman movie and James Gunn's Suicide Squad reboot.","Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
